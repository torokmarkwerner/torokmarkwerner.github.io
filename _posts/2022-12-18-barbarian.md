In spite the obvious generic differences, both <a href="/2022/12/19/8-mile.html">*8 Mile* (2002)</a> and *Barbarian* (2022) are set in Detroit and document vital aspects of the deteriorating city. What's more, the widely celebrated thriller *Don't Breathe* (2016) -- featuring the Hungarian actress Franciska Törőcsik -- also takes place there; there's something in the Detroitan air that not only serves as a particularly fitting setting for these movies, urban space is very much a narrative in itself.

The story of Detroit's downfall starts in the early 20th century. Initially, the establishment of the local auto industry, especially the factories of the Big Three (Ford, General Motors, Crysler) made the city's future prospects very promising. As part of the Great Migration, the Motor City saw an influx of millions of African American workers and their families, which resulted in the city's population growing to 1.85 million. However, Detroit's heavy reliance of one single industry soon led to dire consequences when companies decided for relocation or automation, which in turn resulted in unemployment, poverty, and crime rates to rise.

In the subsequent years, the so-called suburban sprawl intensified, including white population leaving the city in masses (white flight). Racial tensions led to, among others, the 1967 riot, resulting in the death of more than 50 people (including civilians, rioters, and policemen), and causing serious amount of insurance damage.

The riot, alongside with desegregation policies introduced in the field of education (cf. Milliken v. Bradley), led to the continuation of white flight, and gradually, the city was depopulated. By 2021, the population decreased to 630,000, which is just a little over the half of the city's population in 1980. The depopulation of the urban areas was largely supported by infrastructural developments that took place in the course of the last century. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/17/us/detroit-decline.html" target="_blank">As Amy Padnani discusses</a>, Detroit's downfall may also have something to do with the lack of public transport and the establishment of highways under the mayorship of Albert Cobo in the '50s. Highways helped white families leave the city, while the poor means of the public transportation system made the commuting of workers impossible.

After all, it's no wonder that the patchily populated ghost streets of Detroit make up for a perfect setting for a horror movie, just like the blocks of the abandoned Soviet airbase in Kiskunlacháza (as seen in *Chernobyl Diaries* [2012]), or the ghost town stage-set in the Morrocan desert from *The Hills Have Eyes* (2006), or the lonesome streets of New York in *I Am Legend* (2007), emptied by special effects.
