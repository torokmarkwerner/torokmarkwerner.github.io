Both *8 Mile* (2002) and <a href="/2022/12/18/barbarian.html">*Barbarian*</a> (2022) document vital aspects of Detroit's street life, so we're going to take a look at the history of the Motor City.
<!--end-of-excerpt-->
*8 Mile* is a semi-autobiographical movie about B-Rabbit (Eminem), an aspiring rapper in the '90s' rap scene of Detroit. The protagonist seeks to launch a career in hip-hop while stuck in a rat race with his awful job at a car (?) factory and his even more awful family living in a trailer park. The movie creates an original atmosphere of tragicomedy, which is hardly ever seen in similar ghetto movies. They're either overly dramatic, or 

Capturing the essence of the Detroit underworld, the movie never turns into a tragic ghetto drama, as it reserves the everyday, bittersweet comedy of poverty in the process. Take for example Cheddar shooting himself in the thigh after threatening the rival gang with it.
