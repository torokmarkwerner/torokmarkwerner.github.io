The demise of Elisabeth II placed ESL teachers between the horns of a dilemma. Of course, there is nothing new in the palpable tension between the portrayal of Englishmen in coursebooks (such as the English File and Solutions) and the reality of Britain. The tea-sipping, ever so polite Englishmen are what's left from the long-forgotten (?) Empire, and such colonial discourses are still all around us teachers and students of ESL. The way I see it, <i>The Crown</i> is not only an one-of-a-kind historical drama series with elaborate stage design, but also, a product of imaginative speculation, sheding light on stories that have been either kept secret, or blurred by the non-stop media attention that the royal family suffered since the past century.

<p><i>A crown. Not St Edward's, but a crown.</i></p>

The reason I am discussing all this is that there is a scene in the new season of <i>The Crown</i> that I was unable to wrap my head around. The scene revolves around a meeting in Edinburgh, involving the senior members of the royal family and a bunch of lords. The meeting was initiated by the Lord Chamberlain that time, David Ogilvy, and was opened by the late Prince Philip, His Royal Highness.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN: And so, in consultation with Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, we've decided to set up an informal council of war. A task force to safeguard the monarchy's survival in a rapidly changing world. And, since the idea is to find new directions for a way forward...

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS: Ahead.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Sir?

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS: Ahead, David.

LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Way ahead... we would call it the Way Ahead Group.

Why does Prince Philip correct the Lord Chamberlain there?

1. SEMANTICS: LITTLE DIFFERENCE
At first, it got me thinking, "There should be a difference between <i>forward</i> and <i>ahead</i>, or at least some subtle one between <i>the way forward</i> and <i>the way ahead</i>. From what I gathered, there is little difference between them if any. 

2. PRAGMATICS: HE AN OLD GRAMMAR NAZI
Given that His Royal Highness in Season 5 tends to remind the viewers of a doddery old man, it wouldn't surprise us to see him interrupting, correcting people all the time, telling them how to behave, speak, and so on. Were that the case, his interrupting would be, after all, just another symptome of the problem being discussed in the meeting. Eventually, it mirrors the purist attitude that has appeared in then Prince Charles's speech about the English language devolving in a worrying degree. Make no mistake: purist is just a fancy word for what we call a grammar nazi in everyday contexts. And may I go out on a limb to say a grammar nazi is to language is what a ultra-conservative royalist is to society?
