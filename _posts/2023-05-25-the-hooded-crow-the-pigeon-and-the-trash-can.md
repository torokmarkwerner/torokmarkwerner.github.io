I remember when I first saw a hooded crow (*dolmányos varjú*). I was around 15 and went for an afternoon trip from our home town to Budapest. We visited a cosy little park at the Buda end of Elisabeth Bridge, and there were these strange-looking, gray-chested crows.

Of course, I had already seen carrion crows (*kormos varjú*) and rooks (*vetési varjú*), but it seems to me that I hadn't ever come across their hooded relatives before. Since then, I associate hooded crows with the city and carrion crows with the countryside, and I like to think that carrion crows are compelled to move inwards due to the lack of food on the countryside in the winter.

As for the hooded crow, my inference is that it inhabits the city, so much so that it adapted greatly to the big city life. It was years ago when I first noticed that crows fly to trash cans, land on the top of it, and try to fish some food out of it. They also measure how full the can is, and if the trask is too low for them to pinch on, they fly on to the next one, systematically checking the trash cans in the area.
