*The Blind Side* is an inspiring sport drama with Sandra Bullock, who was perfectly casted for a WASP housewife embracing a young African-American athlete.

Although it seems to be the easiest job to do, adapting a biographical book to screen is actually a tricky concept. "Art imitates life", true that, but life itself doesn't necessarily make up for a good movie. And that's where the creators have to step in, and do either of two things (or both of them at the same time).

First of all, they have to **"narrow down"** the story, so that it takes the form of an easy-to-follow narrative with processable concepts, distilled (visual) language. Of course, for fiction, it's sort of a given: stories are always created with some sort of narrative coherence in mind. Hovewer, life is much more complex than that. When it comes to making a biographical movie, creators have to omit certain subplots and characters, so that there's a very basic, inherent emphasis in the biography. Michael Jordan, for example, is a hypercompetitive can-do fighter. John Nash is a peculiar scientist fighting schizophrenia. Just like Frida Kahlo, who is, again, a physically hindered artist with a spirit of a bird, always struggling with an inexplicable attraction to her unfaithful husband.

On the other hand, sometimes biographies needs a little push. That's when screenwriters have to **"add"** to the story, so that a specific aspect of the story is underline. These additions often wreaks havoc online, as they can be interpreted as ignoring one of the most essential criteria of non-fiction, which is truthfulness. Obviously, stories fall far from the world of realism; they depict events from a limited number of select perspectives and are maintained by narrators and interpreters, therefore they can be, at most, construed as interpretations of reality.
