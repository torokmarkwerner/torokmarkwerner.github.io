After all, he already had two. He had been a professor of medicine for years. But after Dr Steiner retired from his career in medicine, he realized he finally had time to do something he’d always wanted to do – study physics.</p><p>At first, he just took a few classes, but after a while, he finished enough classes to complete a regular college degree. That’s when he decided to get a Ph.D. It took him a long time, but at age 89, Dr Steiner finally earned his physics Ph.D. He encourages young people who have a dream to “follow that dream. Don’t give up on it.”</p><p>Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins set a new world record by running the 100-meter dash in just over 62 seconds, which was a slightly slower time than she'd hoped for. If that doesn’t sound like a record to you, keep in mind that Ms Hawkins is 105 years old. Before this year, there wasn’t even a category for female runners over the age of 104. They had to create one for Ms Hawkins, so at age 105, she was in a new age category all her own.</p><p>Running isn’t Ms Hawkins’ main sport – she was a lifelong cyclist before losing interest in this sport late in life because of a lack of competition. She took up running at 100 and soon set her first world record.</p><p>Encouraging others to be active is a big part of what keeps Ms Hawkins running. “My message to others,” she says, “is that you have to stay active if you want to be healthy and happy as you age.”</p>",

The dogs included in the study were pets, volunteered by their owners. First, researchers taught the dogs to use a special smell-testing device. Then, they collected sweat and breath samples from the human participants under two different conditions: in a non-stressful and a stressful situation. When people were calm, their blood pressure and heart rates were measured and then they were asked to wipe their skin with a clean piece of cloth. Then they had to put the cloth sample in a tube and breathe on it hard three times.</p><p>The study team then collected another round of breath and sweat samples a few minutes later, after the people had completed a difficult maths task, counting backward in their heads from 9,000 in units of 17 in front of two researchers for three minutes. The researchers kept telling the people to hurry up. After the task the participants reported feeling stressed, and their blood pressure and heart rate had gone up.</p><p>Then the dogs were given a relaxed and a stressed sample from each person. The dogs correctly identified the stressed sample in 94% of 720 tests.</p><p>The study provides evidence that dogs can smell stress from breath and sweat. Researchers say the skill could be useful when training therapy dogs.</p>",

They had heard a loud noise and seen an explosion in the sky just before Ms Hamilton reported the incident. “The police officer came back in and said: ‘Well, I think you have a meteorite in your bed,’” says Ms Hamilton.</p><p>Ms Hamilton shared the space-rock, which weighs about 1.3 kilograms, with researchers at the University of Western Ontario, which has a collection of meteorites, so they can study it further. &quot;It's certainly a meteorite,&quot; says meteor physicist Peter Brown, member of the research team. &quot;Everything about the story pointed to a meteorite fall, and the fact that the bright fireball had occurred basically right at the same time made it a pretty obvious case.&quot;</p><p>The researchers are asking local residents for videos that may have captured the fall of the fireball. They can use video to reconstruct the path that the meteorite followed from the asteroid belt to Earth.</p><p>Ms Hamilton considers herself lucky to be unharmed. “I didn’t get hurt,” she says. “I didn’t even get a scratch. So, all I had to do is have a shower and mop the floor.”</p><p>Because the meteorite landed on Ms Hamilton’s property, it belongs to her, and she plans to keep it as a souvenir of the unusual night. Her grandchildren also think it’s pretty cool.</p>",

This year’s contest had 49,000 entries from around the world.</p><p>This year’s grand prize winner was Sergey Gorshkov’s picture of a Siberian tiger. Siberian tigers are endangered; only about 500 of them live in Russia’s far east. It took Mr. Gorshkov ten months to get a shot of one of them. It looks like the tiger is hugging the tree, but it’s actually trying to leave its smell as a way of communicating with other tigers.</p><p>Another endangered animal, a glass frog, was a category prize winner. Jaime Culebras said he had walked for four hours in the Andes mountains in the middle of a rainstorm, before he captured the picture of the frog snacking on a spider.</p><p>Mogens Trolle won the Animal Portraits prize with his picture of a young proboscis monkey, which is sitting calmly, enjoying the sunlight with its eyes closed. Proboscis monkeys look strange because the male’s nose can eventually grow so big that it hangs over its mouth and may have to be pushed aside to eat. They’re endangered and only found on Borneo and the islands nearby.</p><p>There is a separate contest for people under 18, known as the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year. In this contest, pictures are judged in three separate age groups.</p><p>In the 10 and under category, Andrés Luis Dominguez Blanco of Spain won with his picture of a bird called a “stonechat” sitting on a bending plant. He asked his father to drive him to the field, in order to use the car as a hiding place for taking photographs. Andrés managed to take the picture without scaring the bird.</p><p>Another young winner, Liina Heikkinen had spent a day watching two adult foxes bring food to their cubs. After one parent brought home a goose, the cubs fought over it. Liina took a picture of a young fox eating the goose, while hiding away from his siblings.</p>",

The amount may seem small, but you can run up a large bill before you even realise it.

That’s what a medical research team is offering to 24 volunteers.</p><p>Researchers are looking for volunteers to help them study the effects of weightlessness on the human body by spending 60 days lying down. Lying in bed isn’t exactly the same as being weightless, but it affects the body in a similar way.</p><p>When astronauts spend a long time in an environment with no gravity, their bodies are affected in many ways; for example, their hearts don’t pump as hard, their muscles become weaker because they no longer have to work against gravity, and their bones may break more easily. There may also be changes in their immune systems and sleep habits.</p><p>The goal of the present study, which will take 88 days altogether, is to measure the effects of weightlessness, and also to find ways to prevent problems. During the first two weeks, the volunteers’ levels of health and fitness will be measured. Then, they will spend 60 days lying in bed with their heads slightly lower than their bodies. They will have to do everything while lying down, including eating, brushing their teeth, and going to the bathroom. The rule is that they must have at least one shoulder touching the bed at all times. Half of the volunteers in the study will be taking special food supplements to see if they help reduce the health problems caused by weightlessness. The last two weeks of the study will be spent taking more measurements and trying to build up their strength again.</p><p>Volunteers must be men between the ages of 20 and 45 who are in perfect health and physically active. They must be non-smokers and have no allergies.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(https://teachingkidsnews.com)</i></p>",

Wishing to demonstrate the two different languages, village chief Oliver Ibang calls over his two young children.</p><p>He holds up a cup and asks his daughter what it is called. &quot;It's <i>ogbala</i>,&quot; she says, without thinking for a moment. But in Ubang's &quot;male language&quot; the word for cup is <i>nko</i>. There are some other examples, such as the word for clothing, which is <i>nki</i> for men and <i>ariga</i> for women.</p><p>It is not clear exactly how many words are different in the two languages. Also, there is no pattern, such as whether the words are commonly used or linked to traditional roles for men or women. There are a lot of words that men and women have in common, then there are others which are totally different depending on your sex. They don't sound alike, they don't have the same letters, they are completely different words. However, both men and women are able to understand each other as well as anywhere else in the world. This might be partly because boys grow up speaking the female language, as they spend most of their childhoods with their mothers and other women. However, by the age of 10, boys are expected to speak the &quot;male language&quot;.</p><p>Ubang people are extremely proud of their language difference but there are different theories about how it happened. &quot;God created Adam and Eve and they were Ubang people,&quot; says the chief. &quot;God's plan was to give each ethnic group two languages, but after creating the two languages for the Ubang, he realised that he simply didn’t have enough languages to hand out. So he stopped,&quot; he explains.</p><p>&quot;That's why Ubang has the benefit of two languages – we are different from other people in the world.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

She was still a young girl and her father was fishing and caught a catfish. She was frightened because she didn’t want it to bite her. In fact, that was the only time she can remember experiencing fear.</p><p>Once, when her sons were small and she was out for a walk, a man called her over. He grabbed her by the shirt, and he held a knife to her throat and told her he was going to cut her. She said, “Go ahead and do it”. The man let her go, and she went home, but she didn’t call the police, as she didn’t see the danger.</p><p>She is also unable to recognise a fearful expression on the face of another person. Still, she has normal intelligence and recognises other emotions such as joy, or anger in the same way as others.</p><p>If she sees a poisonous snake that would make most people really scared, Mary will touch it without any problem. She isn’t afraid in such situations and has no bad memories afterwards.</p><p>‘If you have no fear, many more terrible things will happen to you,’ one of her doctors explained to journalists. ‘However, if you have a lot of fear, fewer bad things will probably happen.’</p><p>So is it better to be fearful or fearless?</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(dailymail.co.uk)</i></p>",

A combination of three reasons makes the third Monday of the year the most miserable. Understanding that Christmas really is over, the realisation of all the holiday expenses and the fact that most of us are back at work all play a part. First invented in Britain, <i>Blue Monday</i> is especially sad in the northern half of the world, where it’s also deep, dark midwinter.</p><p>It was in 2005 that Cliff Arnall, a university lecturer from Wales, dreamt up his gloomy calculation using the above three main factors to find the date of the most depressing day in the year. He also took into account things like the weather, the period since we’ve broken our New Year’s resolutions and our general motivational level.</p><p>However, there is hope, say psychologists, as Blue Monday was really all a marketing trick. January in the UK is peak holiday booking time and the original research was paid for by a travel agent who wanted to persuade people to cheer up by heading to the beach.

So Mike did the right thing, wrapped up the gosling in a towel, and found her family about 100 yards away. But sadly the other geese made it clear that the tiny gosling wasn’t welcome.</p><p>Mike decided he would take the gosling home and care for her until she was fully grown, at which point he would release her into the wild. But the goose, who Mike named Kylie, had other plans. Every time Mike tried to let Kylie fly away, she just kept coming back. She wouldn’t leave him alone.</p><p>After constant attempts to set Kylie free, Mike realised that he had no other option but to accept his new friend. Kylie now follows him everywhere – to the shops, when he’s out on his boat, around the house.</p><p>‘Kylie’s personality is a lot like a person’s,’ says Mike. ‘She has her good days and bad days. She can do things she knows she is not supposed to. Like boarding other people’s boats, harassing neighbors or stealing things from them. She loves to steal small items like keys, wallets, flip flops and throw them in the lake.’</p><p>When they’re together (which is pretty much all the time), Mike and Kylie love to go to Starbucks and watch TV. Kylie loves all shows on the Discovery Channel. She’s also a huge fan of the Ellen Show and Animal Planet. Kylie also loves to go paddle and hang out inside neighbors’ houses when they go on vacation.

But today, you don’t even have to be a manager to give presentations – staff at every level are expected to stand up (9). Below you can read some advice from experts.</p><p>“I always begin my planning with the end in mind,” says Karen Glossop, psychologist. “What are the one or two main points (10)? Plan the talk around your main points and build the structure accordingly.”</p><p>Another expert, who coaches people in communication and presentation skills, suggests that you should make your speech memorable. “Create an opening that grabs attention (11). We naturally remember the first and last bits better than the middle.”</p><p>When clients tell him that they don’t have time to prepare, he advises them to spend just 10 minutes thinking about what it is they want to say: “What is the one thing you want people to take away? When your audience leaves the room, (12)? That way you will structure your message well.”</p><p>The most important thing is to remember your main ideas and not the exact words, says the president of the Academy of Public Speakers. “Prepare in advance (13). While doing so, focus on the message rather than trying to remember every single word in order,” he says. “As no one will know exactly (14), leaving out a word will not cause a problem.”</p><p>“When you practise, include any slides, flip charts, aids or props (15),” he adds. How you present your speech is equally, or maybe even more important than what you say. Speaking slowly and clearly is very important. Don’t rush through your talk, no matter how much (16). “Taking time to pause and breathe helps the speaker to feel less stressed, and helps support the voice”.</p><p>Psychologists say we should never turn down a chance to speak.

He is currently working with high-ranking members of other Christian churches to agree on a fixed date for Easter.</p><p>In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle.</p><p>The issue is back on the agenda as Easter is the most important Christian festival. It celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday. The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew. Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen &quot;in between five and ten years’ time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would love to see it before I retired,&quot; he said, although he warned that the first time they tried to make such a change was in the 10th century. An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then.</p><p>Easter is on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, which usually falls on the 21<sup>st</sup> of March, when day and night are equally long. This means that Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22<sup>nd</sup> March and 25<sup>th</sup> April. However, the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, and so it has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity.</p><p>It is yet to be seen whether this latest attempt to fix the date will be successful.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

Taking a nap for about half an hour is the most practical. If you want to try it yourself, have a coffee beforehand, so that it takes effect towards the end of your nap. Don’t sip your coffee too slowly, as you might find it’s already taking effect as you begin your nap.</p><p>The truth is that we can nap anywhere. The best way is to find a spot where you can make yourself comfortable at some point during the afternoon period – an unused office, the sofa in the staff room or even in the park. Then close your eyes and just let go. Some people say that they simply “can’t nap” and they won’t be able to fall asleep. But here is the thing: it doesn’t matter. What’s important is that you use this period to close your eyes and disconnect from the world for a short while.</p><p>After a nap, take five minutes to become aware of your surroundings and have a cup of tea or a glass of water. One more thing - light will reduce any tiredness quickly, so you will be full of energy and enjoy all the benefits of your nap.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

When he left, his bike was gone.” He was outraged.</p><p>“I realized that the biggest problem is that most people don’t know that the lock that they bought for $20 is absolutely worthless. It costs at least $100 to get at least somewhere close to where you can at least limit the chances of a thief wanting to steal your bike. With the right tools a thief could cut through most locks in less than a minute. Thieves talk in seconds: a 15-second bike, a 20-second bike, and it goes up to 60-second bikes.”</p><p>Idzkowski created a U-shaped lock of carbon and steel with a hollow chamber to hold a pressurized gas. When someone cuts about 30% of the way into the lock the gas erupts in the direction of the cut. “It’s pretty much immediately vomit inducing,” Idzkowski said.</p><p>The inventors have tested it on themselves and volunteers at distances of 50cm and 2 metres. “At 50cm it was pretty bad.

Ten years ago, people would rather hang over a crocodile pit than admit they met online. But today the climate is much less disapproving. Dating has changed extremely fast. It had to. Not only does the UK have a high concentration of single people, but many of us work in virtually single-sex environments. Couples I know are too busy to have dinner parties. We lack the village hall dances our parents went to. Like people in the US, we welcome different ways to meet. A third of all new relationships start online. It’s our best matchmaker. Among my friends, I don’t know anyone who hasn’t met online.</p><p>Survey results reveal the British to be enlightened and open-minded about how we meet a significant other. As someone who fell in love online, I do think internet dating is a good thing. Of course it’s lovely to meet in “real life”. The fact that someone has walked across a room and chosen you is a great help. But that room is getting smaller. Sign up to a dating website and you have more than 1,000 matches. Of course you won’t always fancy each other. But you can at least be kind and friendly for an hour. To be honest, the first meeting isn’t a date. You’re meeting for a chat to see if you would like to spend more time together.</p><p>Yes, it can feel a bit like an audition. But it’s good to be put into a situation where you have to put your cards on the table. And I guess in my job I develop email relationships with so many people, it no longer seems odd to “meet” online.</p><p>(The Observer)</p>",

Don't worry if some people call black tea red, because this is its name in several Asian countries.</p><p><b>White Tea</b></p><p>White tea is the rarest of all teas and it is made with very young leaves, which have a light colour. It is widely believed that the caffeine level of white tea is higher than in green tea, although some scientists say the opposite. Studies have also shown that it is better against viruses and bacteria than green tea.</p><p><b>Green Tea</b></p><p>Green tea is closely related to white tea. It has a similar taste, but it uses rolled leaves. Green tea has been studied far more than any other tea and many scientists say it is good for people on a slimming diet. If you don’t like those visits to the dentist, there is good news for you: green tea keeps your teeth healthy, too.</p><p><b>Oolong Tea</b></p><p>The final type of true tea is oolong tea. As for its strength, it falls between green and black. It has neither the rosy aroma of black tea nor the grassy taste of green tea.

We're like anarchists on bikes who know how to break the rules,&quot; said Rolf Hermsen, who is one of the many city residents who use their bikes to get around. &quot;The tourists try to keep the rules, but they can't cycle properly. They can't cycle while looking for traffic behind them, so they just fall over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are people who say tourists need more instructions to ride bikes,&quot; said Jo Ligtvoeld from the Tourist Board. &quot;More and more Dutch people are complaining about tourists. I think it's because Amsterdam is a small city compared to other European capitals.&quot;</p><p>Amsterdam also has a reputation as a &quot;freedom city&quot; for allowing marijuana smoking and for its red light district. The city attracts thousands of tourists each year, who are often responsible for noise pollution and garbage on the streets. The Tourist Board says that it’s these visitors, rather than the cycling ones, that create the most problems with local residents.</p><p>However, when it comes to cycling, Amsterdam residents are good at spotting the tourist-on-wheels. &quot;Tourists should, just like the locals, have lights on their bikes and follow general traffic instructions. Just because Amsterdam likes freedom, that does not mean there are no rules to be followed,&quot; Jo Ligtvoeld said.</p><p>Her solution to the conflict between visitors and residents is to attract tourists to the less busy parks and cycleways of Amsterdam's quieter suburbs. Anyway, if you do choose to cycle in Amsterdam, the Tourism Board's website helpfully explains where you can rent bikes and how to follow Amsterdam's traffic rules.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

The campaign was the idea of Huw Kingston, who owns the local bike shop.

The hacker, CyFi, gave a presentation about his findings at DefCon Kids, which held its first meeting during the larger DefCon hacker conference. The conference now has sessions for young people who are interested in trying things out in hardware and software.</p><p>CyFi found that advancing the clock on a tablet or phone, in many games, makes it possible to get access to data which are not meant for the public. He discovered the bug after getting bored with the pace of farming games and seeking ways to speed them up.</p><p>Many farm-based games force players to wait hours before they can produce fruit or crops grown from virtual seeds. As a result CyFi, who has not revealed his real name, started manipulating the clock on his handset to see if he could make the game faster.</p><p>By disconnecting his phone from wi-fi and only advancing the clock by small amounts, he found the game in a state not tested by its original creators. CyFi's discovery has since been inspected by independent security researchers. Exactly which games are unprotected has not been revealed, to give their creators time to fix them.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(http://www.bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

The video tape shows her getting out of the truck and bending over him. She and Mr Hall estimate that he was unconscious for four or five minutes. When he came to, Mr Hall saw Miss Fenn and store employees hovering over him. It soon became apparent that an ambulance was needed. “I wanted to get up, but my body wouldn’t allow me to,” Mr Hall said. “I couldn’t move. My heart was beating very fast. It was just … very scary.”</p><p>The current apparently traveled through the rain slick on the pavement to Hall. It probably wouldn’t have happened if the surface hadn’t been wet.

Often it's just foolish actions caused by tiredness and general stress. At the weekend, however, it seems to change to students (24).</p><p>Students' practical jokes have also been blamed for the number of emergency calls. Once a plastic traffic sign was melted on a gas hob in King's College and a month later clothes caught fire (25).</p><p>Mr Meikle also pointed out that hoax calls and practical jokes causing fire could bring serious consequences. He warned students that – depending on the gravity of the misbehaviour – they could face severe punishment, (26).</p><p>Cambridge University chiefs have started campaigns along with the fire service and the students' union in order to keep students safe. A spokesman said: &quot;The university takes fire safety very seriously.

        "text": "<p>Every winter, some 1.25 million Britons migrate to the Alps, where they find purpose-built resorts with fantastic slopes near villages that are so commercialised that it’s impossible to move without ringing a cowbell. More and more people are beginning to realise that there are other things you can do in the mountains besides downhill skiing, and that away from the fashionable slopes there are exciting areas of country to be discovered.</p><p>Two ways of reaching parts of the Alps that others don’t are heli-skiing (flying in a helicopter to a mountain and skiing down from there) and para-gliding (jumping from a high place and floating slowly to the ground with a parachute-like structure). Of course, you have to be extremely rich to do the first and experienced and mad-brave to do the second.</p><p>A much gentler way of getting to the Alpine outback is heels-free or Nordic skiing (skiing across the countryside), which is the traditional Scandinavian method of winter travel. Using flexible boots and lightweight skis wrapped in skins (one-sided Velcro these days) it’s possible to climb most slopes. And the thing about heels-free skiing is that it is a journey; using mountain huts that offer everything from beds and showers to hot meals and cold beers, it is possible to spend whole weeks on the hill. It’s an eco-friendly form of discovery, too: no buses, no trains, no lifts, no hotels, no street lights, no crowded streets or car parks. Best of all you will never meet that curse of downhill skiing: the queue.</p><p>If you don’t feel athletic enough to do this, rent a house in one of the smaller villages, those that lie below the snowline but are only 15 minutes or so by bus from the nearest lift. By living in a small village you’ll have a better chance of knowing your neighbours, and if you stay long enough, you may even be accepted as part of the community.</p>",

In fact, I never planned to write it at all, and when the story took hold, I was busy writing the third part of a historical trilogy. I had no time to spare for anything, let alone a six-book series about Stone Age hunter-gatherers.</p><p>Then one afternoon when I was leafing through some old notes, I came across a manuscript I had written at university, 20-odd years before. It was about a boy and a wolf struggling to survive in a forest. Something about it quickened my pulse. I wanted to rewrite it.</p><p>So I started running scenes in my mind’s eye, like a film. The demon-haunted bear rampaging through the forest … Torak, the 12-year old hero watching his father die … A stampede of reindeer seen through the eyes of a wolf … Soon I was scribbling in my notebook. I lived the adventure alongside Torak and Wolf. The research took me to places I had never thought I’d see, and I ended up sleeping on reindeer skins in Lapland.</p><p>Somebody once said that one’s real life is often the life that one does not lead. That’s true for me. When I was a child, I wanted a wolf, and a bow and an arrow, and to live like the Stone Age people. I wanted to build my own shelter and go hunting in the forest. I tried it, too. I got rid of my bed and slept on the floor for three years. I made tea from different herbs, and gave it to my little sister.</p><p>When I became an adult I didn’t grow out of all that, but it went underground. The childhood obsessions became a love of archaeology and the natural world; a fascination with the myths of Inuits and Native Americans; a lasting interest in wolf behaviour. <i>Wolf Brother</i> came to life when I realised that <i>this</i> was the world I had lost. This was the life I hadn’t led.</p>",

There are 22 wine regions in Hungary and the variation in wine styles produced is pretty impressive. From Methode Champenoise styles to fruity dry whites and reds, to some of the sweetest wines on the planet – there’s something for everyone.</p><p>One of the biggest difficulties for consumers though can be reading the labels on the bottles. But as there are a growing number of English labels on the market, it is possible to go shopping without a translator.</p><p>Of the 22 tongue twisting regions the most well-known is unquestionably the region of Tokaj-Hegyalja, which produces some of the most respected sweet wines in the world. In the 16th century, the European royal families drank Tokaji and ever since it’s taken a special place in all the great wine cellars of the world. There are many other wine regions worth visiting including Villány, Somló (quite rustic and traditional wines), Neszmély and Eger (home of the famous Bull’s Blood red wine).</p><p>The wine regions in Hungary are situated in some of the most beautiful areas of the country so visiting them will, at the very least, ensure you get a few great photos to take back home.

More than 52,000 speeders in Lancashire, where the scheme has been tested for three years, took up the offer.</p><p>Police said the aim of the ‘one last chance’ initiative was to win back public support after the Government’s controversial speed camera policy, which critics say is a money-making exercise. More than two million motorists were fined £60 and penalised with three points on their licence last year after being snapped by Britain’s 6,000 cameras.</p><p>The scheme was launched yesterday by Richard Brunstrom of the Association of Chief Police officers, as he chaired a national road policing conference in Birmingham. Mr Brunstrom said: ‘If I have any regret, it is that we didn’t start these speed awareness courses earlier. In retrospect, I wish we’d done it at the start.’</p><p>He claimed that up to 30 per cent of drivers who are offered the course will take it.</p><p>The courses comprise classroom and practical driving lessons teaching errant drivers the danger of breaking the limit. Motorists will take a two-hour and a half-hour lesson identifying what causes them to ignore the limit, the consequences of speeding, followed by up to three hours of practical training and exercises behind the wheel with an advanced driving instructor.</p><p>Motorists can only take one course in three years.</p><p>Mr Brunstrom said: ‘A national scheme means you could get done for speeding in Devon, but take your course in Edinburgh.’</p>",

Now, she travels to the place where the story began.</i></p><p>When I was little, my father used to tell me stories about Mexico, where he worked in the 1960s. He had travelled there from India, before settling in London. It was the first time he’d travelled abroad, and the contrast was so sharp that it left a lasting impression: he would talk about Mexico at every opportunity.</p><p>The Mexico he remembered was full of legends and magical characters, and these have influenced much of my writing. This year, finally, I set out to find the places he told us about. My aim was to go to Oaxaca, 500km southeast of Mexico City, but on my way I wanted to visit a typical Mexican town, and chose Puebla, an hour east of the capital.</p><p>A Mexican writer once said, “For Mexicans, colours shout so loudly that you cannot hear the silence of darkness.” This is so true. In Mexico City colour is everywhere, from children’s green school uniforms to clear blue walls. Only on the outskirts are houses uniform grey. My driver Jose says the poor don’t use colour on the outside of their houses. “Colour is symbolic of wealth.”</p><p>We head out towards Puebla, among the mountains, and Jose points out two snow-covered volcanic peaks. Popocatepetl is tall, while the White Lady is much smaller. As we drive, Jose tells me a Romeo and Juliet kind of story. It is the same one my father told me as a child.</p><p>Popo is away fighting, and his fiancée is wrongly informed that he is dead. Heart-broken, she dies. Popo returns, finds her dead body, and remains close by her for ever. Today he is an angry volcano, ready to erupt any moment and, if you look carefully, the White Lady has the form of a young woman lying down.</p><p>I arrive in Puebla on Sunday. The buildings are quite magnificent and the town is full of life with musicians playing and people dancing in the main square.</p><p>By the end of our journey through the Sierra Madre, we arrive in a dry, red desert area. We reach Oaxaca and head straight into town. The air in the market smells of hot chocolate and freshly baked bread and there are racks of fruit, spices and chillies everywhere.</p><p>When I finally come to the end of my stay I find it incredibly difficult to leave Mexico. I understand now, perfectly, why my father could never forget this country.</p>",

From today, new migrants to Britain will be expected to answer 24 similar questions if they are to get a British passport.

The 20% whose English is still not adequate after this time will have to do a combined English language and citizenship course. The estimated 60-80% of new migrants who do have a working knowledge of English will have to pay £34 to do the 24 multiple- choice question test on British life. The questions are based on Life in the UK, a Government publication that candidates are expected to read. The test covers topics that include the changing role of women, the make-up of the population in Britain, religion, customs and traditions, how the political system works, and the position of children.</p><p>The test has a pass mark of 75% and, like the driving test, those who fail can take it again at a cost of £34 a time until they pass.</p><p>Teachers of English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) who will prepare new migrants for the tests said they were surprised at how difficult some of the questions were.

        "text": "<p>The Cardsharps, a painting by Caravaggio, is a masterpiece of late 16th century art. In the 17th century another famous painter, Georges de la Tour, also chose cheating at cards as the subject of two of his works. This shows how ingrained cheating is in our society. Some even say that games in general and card games in particular were only invented so that people could cheat. That’s why card games are so full of words such as knave and tricks.</p><p>Cheating in school and university exams is a worldwide phenomenon. In 1995, schools in Nigeria reportedly insisted that girls remove their underwear before taking exams because so many had been smuggling in crib sheets. In 1996, an Italian teacher was suspended for passing students answers hidden in salami sandwiches. In some parts of the world, cheating is almost institutionalised. In 1999, thousands of Bangladeshi students were expelled for demanding the right to cheat in exams. In the nearby Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, however, exam cheats can be sentenced to 10 years in jail.</p><p>Cheating in sports is also widespread. An interesting example is the butterfly stroke in swimming: you could actually say that it was a result of cheating. In 1933, an American, Henry Myers, used butterfly as a means of legally evading the intention of the rules in breaststroke races. It took the authorities until 1953 before the laws were sorted out and butterfly was recognised as a distinct stroke.</p><p>Some cheats never get caught, of course, but it is worth quoting the example of one such person. In February this year, a high school principal in the US State of Colorado received a letter from a 65-year-old grandmother confessing to having cheated in an English Literature exam 47 years ago. “I know it makes no difference now,” she said, “but maybe it will keep some students from cheating and help them to be honest – conscience never lets you forget.”</p>",

        "text": "<p>When 34-year-old Somerset farmer Michael Eavis started the first Glastonbury Festival in 1970 - with free milk for every festival-goer – he didn’t really know what he had started.</p><p>Glastonbury was not the first or biggest rock festival in Britain's fields. But it was the event that kickstarted the UK's love affair with outdoor music events.</p><p>From metal fans to clubbing mums, from loud students to fans of alternative culture, there seems to be something for everyone.</p><p><h4>Glastonbury 'catalyst'</h4></p><p>Glastonbury had a reputation for poor security - which allowed thousands of festival-goers to see the event for free by jumping the fence - until there was a one-year break in 2001.</p><p>Then the organisers got that super-fence in 2002, which means if you buy a ticket now for Glastonbury that's the only way you can get in. You can't just waltz in like people could in the past.</p><p><h4>24-hour sell-out</h4></p><p>By 2003 festivals had become very popular. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin brand had started the V festival in 1996. It was so successful that some years later a similar one was organised in Reading and also in Leeds.</p><p>&quot;We put our tickets on sale at 2004 prices just after last year's event, and we sold a third of them immediately,&quot; says organiser Geoff Ellis. &quot;Then in February we put the rest of the tickets on sale, and were the first UK festival to sell out four days later,&quot; he says.</p><p>&quot;Maybe some years ago dance culture was bigger, but now people seem to have gone back to guitar music and rock music,&quot; he adds.</p><p><h4>Festival 'holiday'</h4></p><p>The need for festivals comes as people's lifestyles change, he believes.</p><p>&quot;When I started going to festivals in the early 1970s, the idea that someone as old as 22 or 23 would go to a festival was strange. People that age were preparing to get married and buy a house.</p><p>&quot;A festival has become almost like a holiday. Instead of going away to Spain for two weeks, people are taking some of their holiday and taking five days off for Glastonbury or Reading.&quot;</p>",

The Romans called upon one of their gods, Lupercus, to keep the wolves away. A holiday in honor of Lupercus was celebrated on February 15th. The holiday was celebrated as a spring festival. Their calendar was different at that time, with February falling in early springtime.</p><p>One of the customs of the young people was <i>name-drawing</i>. On the day before the festival of <i>Lupercalia</i>the names of Roman girls were written on slips of paper and placed into jars. Each young man got a slip from the jar. The girl whose name was chosen was to be his sweetheart for the year.</p><p>Legend says that the holiday became Valentine's Day after a priest named Valentine. Valentine was a priest in Rome at the time Christianity was a new religion. The Emperor at that time, Claudius II, ordered the Roman soldiers NOT to marry or become engaged. Claudius believed that as married men, his soldiers would want to stay home with their families rather than fight his wars. Valentine didn’t obey the Emperor's order and secretly married the young couples. He was finally arrested, imprisoned, and put to death. Valentine was killed on February 14th, the eve of the Roman holiday <i>Lupercalia</i>. After his death, Valentine was named a saint. As Rome became more Christian, the priests moved the spring holiday from the 15th of February to the 14th - Valentine's Day. Now it became a holiday of Saint Valentine instead of Lupercus.</p>",

Here’s what experts say to solve your family washing-up conflicts.</p><p>(1) Most dishwashers have inbuilt sensors that measure how much dirt is in the water from the first cycle. Rinsed plates may fool the system, and your dishwasher’s going to think that your plates are cleaner than they actually are, so it won’t wash as intensely, and they might actually come out dirtier.</p><p>(2) Remember to stack the dirtiest items on the lower shelf and the cleaner items above. This is also why your bowls, containers and cutlery should face down.</p><p>(3) During the final rinse cycle, a heat load is built up on the dishes, and then it just sits there for a while and the moisture will evaporate. The more the dishes, the more the heat, the better the result.</p><p>(4) You really don’t want to get it on your hands. Dishwashers need aggressive chemicals to get the job done without mechanical scrubbing. Many materials, however, won’t survive a high-pH hurricane every night, so anything that is older than the dishwasher, like grandma’s china, shouldn’t go in one.</p><p>(5) The same goes for wood, bone, copper, non-stick coated pans and trays. Anything laminated can be twisted out of shape; anything glued can come apart; chefs’ knives will rust and dull.</p><p>(6) A dishwasher can clean 144 items with roughly 13 litres of water. Hand washing the same load uses, on average, 100 litres of water. Most of the energy that goes into running your dishwasher is actually heating the water, and it’s the same for hand washing, so much less water in dishwashing means much less energy.</p>",

The survey — the largest of its kind — asked 10,000 young people in 10 countries how they felt about climate change and government responses to it.</p><p>The results, released in September 2021, found that most respondents were concerned about climate change, with nearly 60% saying they felt ‘very worried’ or ‘extremely worried’. Many associated negative emotions with climate change — the most commonly chosen were ‘sad’, ‘afraid’, ‘anxious’, ‘angry’ and ‘powerless’. Overall, 45% of participants said their feelings about climate change impacted their daily lives.</p><p>The countries with the highest proportion of respondents who felt ‘very worried’ or ‘extremely worried’ by climate change were the Philippines (84%), India (68%) and Brazil (67%), nations that have been hard-hit by climate change. Portugal — where wildfires are becoming increasingly severe — also had a high level of ‘very worried’ or ‘extremely worried’ respondents (65%).</p><p>Among those who said they have talked to others about climate change (81%), nearly half reported being ignored. “There seems to be a dismissal of young people’s opinions in society,” says study co-author Caroline Hickman, a climate-psychology researcher at the University of Bath, UK. Until now, there has been little research on the psychological impacts of climate change on young people, she adds.</p><p>When asked about how governments are responding to climate change, 65% of respondents agreed with the statement that governments are failing young people, 64% agreed that they are lying about the impact of actions taken and 60% agreed they were dismissing people’s distress. </p><p>Only 36% agreed that governments are acting according to science. However, young people do feel reassured when governments act.</p><p>“I think this research will impact more audiences than other arguments about why we should do more on climate,” Ray says.</p>",

        "text": "<p>A great book might stay with us for a long time but, often, its cover does, too. There’s a famous saying about never forming your opinion of a book by the jacket on it. But most readers know that we do judge books by their covers all the time. Everything about a book’s cover – the font, the images, the colours – tells us something about what we can expect to find inside. A reader looking for some thrilling detective story is unlikely to reach for a pastel-coloured cover with a romantic design.</p><p>Covers can be a swift way to signal genre, but the good ones do more than that. They give a face to a book’s personality. They’re what will make you pick it up in the first place, then keep it on your shelf to remind you what it meant to you. “When you’re reading a book, it stays with you for a while, literally,” says Donna Payne, creative director at Faber & Faber.</p><p>The emergence of ebooks posed a threat to physical books a decade or so ago. But publishers fought back, making books that were more beautiful to look at and to hold than ever before. Fonts got bolder, colours are brighter. Alongside this, people increasingly started posting pictures of books on social media. Search #bookstagram on Instagram and you’ll find more than 43 million images of books – next to cups of coffee, lying on crisp duvet covers, or perched on the edge of sun loungers.</p><p>All this means cover design is more important than ever. “I think people are really appreciating it as art again,” says Payne. But what makes a great cover? “For us, it’s one that provokes a reaction of some sort. It might be that not everyone loves the cover. Or it might be that everyone is talking about it. But what we don’t ever want to do is produce covers that are bland.”</p><p>Payne says creating a cover that is true to the book is just as important as creating something memorable. “You can publish an incredibly beautiful cover that leads people to believe it’s a certain type of book, and if the reading experience is quite different from that, they feel they’re not getting what they’ve paid for. You’ve failed in finding the right readers for that book.”</p>",

        "text": "<p>A new rule forcing Germans to take their dog for a walk twice a day has unleashed a debate on whether the state can decide what is best for the country’s 9.4 million pet canines.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner announced this week she had taken expert advice and was introducing a law to ensure dogs go for a walk or run in the garden at least twice a day for a total of an hour. “Pets are not cuddly toys – they also have their own needs, which need to be taken into account,” said Kloeckner, adding that pets must get sufficient exercise and not be left alone for too long.</p><p>The rules are based on new scientific findings that show dogs need a “sufficient measure of activity and contact with environmental stimuli”, especially in the form of spending time in green areas and out of the city. Tying dogs on a chain or a lead for long periods also faces an all-out ban.</p><p>With almost one in five German homes owning a hound, the new Animal Welfare Regulation, which also sets limits on the transportation of farm animals in hot weather, affects a significant proportion of the population.</p><p>“Compulsory Walkies for Dog Owners? Rubbish!” wrote one of the top-selling German newspapers in a heated opinion piece on the new decree. Its author, Udo Kopernik, the spokesman for the National German Dog Association, said most owners were laughing at the new rule because they already spent enough time walking their four-legged friend. “One rule for all dogs is probably well meant but unrealistic,” he said. Dog trainer Anja Striegel seems to concur when she claims that the amount of exercise a dog needs depends on the health, age and breed of the animal.</p><p>“For a young and fit Labrador two hours of walkies are healthier than for a sickly Pekingese with heart problems,” she said in an interview. Germany’s most popular breeds are the German Shepherd and short-legged, long-bodied Dachshund, known as “sausage dogs”, followed by Labradors, and French spaniels.</p><p>Then there is the question of enforcement. The ministry has said the regional governments will be responsible for enforcing the rule, but as one dog owner, Lisa, said: “I find it patronising to be told how long I should take my dog out for. Ridiculous!</p>",

        "text": "<p>To celebrate Kid Inventors' Day, we have collected a few inventions from the past which were hatched in the minds of children.</p><p>Eleven-year-old Frank Epperson invented the popsicle. On a winter’s eve in 1905, Frank forgot to bring inside a fruit-flavoured soft drink that he had left on his porch. He accidentally left the drink outside overnight, with the stirring stick in the glass. The drink froze solid, and a delicious dessert was born.</p><p>A young gymnast, George Nissen invented the trampoline in 1930, at the age of 16. After seeing trapeze artists drop into the safety net beneath them, he thought it would be exciting to perform tricks while bouncing around. He designed a device for bouncing with a metal frame and a canvas stretched over it with rubber springs. When trampoline gymnastics was made an Olympic sport in 2008, 94-year-old George attended the event as a guest of honour.</p><p>In 1873 Chester Greenwood was just 15 years old when his ears got painfully cold one day while ice skating. He designed a wire frame and asked his grandmother to sew beaver skins to it – thereby making the first pair of earmuffs. He ended up patenting the invention by age 19 and even selling them to soldiers during the First World War.</p><p>Canadian Joseph-Armand Bombardier was interested in mechanics and in 1922, at the age of 15, he invented the snowmobile. First, he developed a propeller-driven sleigh, which was the first vehicle that could travel over snow. Later he moved on to cars that he modified with chains and tracks so that they could carry passengers and goods over ice and snow. With the launch of the Ski-Doo in 1959, he created a new recreational sport.</p><p>In the early 1700s, at age 11, Benjamin Franklin invented swim flippers. He was a keen swimmer and wanted to increase his speed in the water. He designed handheld fins made out of oval-shaped planks of wood with holes in the middle for his hands. Unlike today's modern flippers that are worn on the feet, his swim fins were strapped to the swimmer's hands to make each stroke more efficient.</p>",

We’d been on the phone for 20 minutes as I tried to exchange a full-fare, exchangeable plane ticket. Sitting calmly at home, my eyes took in the beauty of my Parisian apartment. Over the last 18 years, I’d learned to see the beauty that surrounded me as compensation for living in a society where the default answer to almost every question, request or suggestion is a disheartening ‘<i>non</i>’ (no).</p><p>A conversation with French friends and family about their use of ‘<i>non</i>’ and why it seems to be the national default reads like the script for a Gérard Depardieu comedy. “No, it’s not true, we don’t always say ‘no’ first,” retorted the 60-something businessman. “No, you’re right, even when we agree, we start with no,” reacted the lawyer. “Hunh, no… I don’t know why…” pondered the young artist.</p><p>Olivier Giraud, a French comedian explains this reflex by saying, “We must not forget that the French are a people of protest, and a protest always starts with a ‘<i>non</i>’.” Indeed, the French have been protesting more or less non-stop since the citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille prison in 1789. Authors Julie Barlow and Jean-Benoît Nadeau agree, “The French Revolution was about the irrevocable right of all citizens to refuse.”</p><p>Yet ‘<i>non</i>’ in France does not always mean ‘no’. “Contrary to popular opinion, the French do listen, and well, but this usually happens <i>after</i> they say no a couple of times. It takes a certain amount of faith, and sometimes a lot of talking, but you can almost always find the yes hiding behind a French no, if it’s there,” write Barlow and Nadeau.</p><p>Hoping to get to this hidden yes, I re-explained my need for a flight that night. The booking agent replied that the airline required one day’s notice to exchange tickets. I asked if that was 24 hours or one calendar day. Since that was not a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question, she was able to tell me it was a calendar day. “When is the very first flight the next day?” I enquired. It was five minutes after midnight – exactly 35 minutes after the flight I had been trying to book for my trip. At last, I had my yes.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Robert Epstein was looking for love. As he recounted in the journal <i>Scientific American Mind</i>, he began a promising email exchange with a pretty, warm and friendly girl in Russia. Soon she confessed she was developing a crush on him. &quot;I have very special feelings about you, a beautiful flower blossoming in my soul...&quot;</p><p>It took a long while for Epstein to notice that Ivana never really responded directly to his questions. Suspicious, he eventually sent her a line of pure bang-on-the-keyboard gibberish. She responded by repeating sweet nothings about how much she liked him. At last, Epstein realised the truth: Ivana was a chatbot.</p><p>What makes the story surprising is not that a chatbot managed to trick a lonely middle-aged man. It is that the man who was tricked was one of the founders of a test of artificial conversation in which computers try to fool humans into thinking that they, too, are human. In other words, one of the world's top chatbot experts had spent two months writing love letters to a computer programme.</p><p>One of the first and most famous early chatbots, Eliza, would successfully imitate a human psychotherapist. It was programmed in the mid-1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum. If you typed, &quot;my husband made me come here&quot;, Eliza might simply reply, &quot;your husband made you come here.&quot; If you mentioned feeling angry, Eliza might ask, &quot;do you think coming here will help you not to feel angry?&quot; People did not care that Eliza was not human: they seemed pleased that someone would listen to them without judgement. Weizenbaum's secretary famously asked him to leave the room so that she could talk to Eliza in private.</p><p>Psychotherapists were fascinated. A contemporary article in a medical journal said that &quot;several hundred patients an hour could be handled by a computer system.&quot; Supervising an army of bots, the human therapist would be far more efficient. And indeed, some therapies are now administered by chatbots, such as Woebot. There is no pretence that they are human.</p><p>Chatbots are now widely used in call centres, handling a growing number of complaints and enquiries. Babylon Health is a chatbot that quizzes people about their medical symptoms and decides whether they should be referred to a doctor.</p><p>Economists today argue that automation reshapes jobs rather than destroying them.</p><p>Computers take over the routine tasks and humans supply the creativity and adaptability.</p>",

Humans can only survive for about 15 seconds in the vacuum of space without a protective shell, and even if they could survive longer, they would quickly receive a fatal dose of radiation from the sun.</p><p>An efficient spaceship like the International Space Station (ISS) reuses 93 percent of the wastewater generated by its occupants, converting it into either clean water or oxygen. All the more important as every astronaut needs a personal supply of water. It is a fundamental necessity, not only to keep the body alive, but to keep it clean, and it’s an essential additive for the foods that accompany astronauts into space, which are all stored in a dried state. Preferred space foods are those that don't crumble – weightless crumbs get in everyone's way and can harm instruments. Astronauts need to follow a balanced diet, and because weightlessness dulls the sense of taste, most prefer spicy meals.</p><p>Personal hygiene is just as important in space as it is on Earth; astronauts can take showers, but they usually do it with a sponge to preserve supplies. In addition, they use soap and shampoo that work without water. In order to stay fit and fight the weakening effect of weightlessness on the leg and lower back muscles, anyone going to space for an extended period has a greater than usual need of some sort of gym equipment; otherwise, even the simplest activities would become extremely exhausting after you return home from a space mission.</p><p>If musical instruments aren't on your A-list of space supplies, then think again.

        "text": "<p>Here is a dead-end job: Swedish bank robber. Two years ago there were only two bank robberies in all of Sweden, compared with 110 eight years earlier. Why the steep plunge? It is because the country is going cashless.</p><p>In 1661 Sweden became the first European country to print banknotes; several centuries later, it might become the first country to get rid of them. Card readers and mobile-payment apps are now used even in situations that were once reserved for dog-eared paper money and pocket change, like donating in church. Buses in Sweden don’t accept cash. Neither do street traders.</p><p>Though the government is still printing Sweden’s national currency, the kroner, two-thirds of Swedes say they feel that they could live without banknotes and coins. The kroner accounted for barely 2 percent of the value of all payments made last year and fewer than half of Swedish banks keep any cash on hand.</p><p>Which might be why Swedish thieves are undertaking more and more bizarre crimes, including a recent series of breaking into moving delivery trucks from a car travelling 50 miles an hour, its lights off to avoid detection. After several such attacks, the Swedish postal service, PostNord, managed to catch the highway robbers by wiring a truck with cameras, filling it with Apple products and waiting. On a road somewhere in southwest Sweden the robbers took the bait and cops moved in. “Thieves are more interested in high-value items now than cash,” says PostNord’s head of security.</p><p>Criminals have also shown new enthusiasm for the trade in endangered species. Crimes involving protected species recently reached their highest level in a decade. A single great gray owl – known as the “phantom of the North” – now goes for 1 million kroner (about $120,000) on the dark web.</p><p>Though it is no small irony that going cashless might inspire more crime rather than less, it is, from one perspective, predictable. Research indicates that as we gain “psychological distance” from money, our willingness to steal increases. Which helps explain why so many people cheat on taxes, inflate insurance claims and steal Post-it Notes from the office.</p><p>Or steal electronic goods from moving delivery trucks.</p><p>(<i>The Atlantic</i>)</p>",

Their dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5°C states that the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3°C.</p><p>Staying below 1.5°C will require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. It will be hugely expensive, the report says, but the window of opportunity is not yet closed.</p><p>After three years of research and a week of discussions with government officials from across the globe at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5°C.</p><p>The critical 33-page <i>Summary for Policymakers</i> is the result of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear.</p><p>The first is that limiting warming to 1.5°C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to 2°C. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways.</p><p>The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5°C – changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to transportation.</p><p>“Scientists might want to write in capital letter, ‘ACT NOW IDIOTS’, but they need to say that with facts and numbers,” said an observer at the negotiations. “And they have.”</p><p>The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below 2°C this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This study says that going past 1.5°C is risking the planet’s liveability. And the 1.5°C temperature limit could be passed in little more than a decade.</p><p>We can stay below it but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals, plus we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, around 2.5% of global GDP, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground.

        "text": "<p>It’s hard to overstate the benefits of a night’s rest for human memory, and neuroscientists are just beginning to understand why.</p><p>Jakke Tamminen has plenty of students who do that very studenty thing of staying up all night right before an exam, in the hope of stuffing in as much knowledge as they can. But “that’s the worst thing you can do,” the psychology lecturer at the UK’s Royal Holloway University warns them. He should know. Tamminen is an expert on how sleep affects memory.</p><p>In Tamminen’s ongoing research project, participants learn new vocabulary, then stay awake all night. Tamminen compares their memory of those words after a few nights, and then after a week. Even after several nights of recovery sleep, there is a substantial difference in how well they recall those words compared to the control group of participants who didn’t face sleep deprivation.</p><p>“Sleep is really a central part of learning,” he says.</p><p>Tamminen’s sleep lab is a sparsely decorated room with a bed and a small electroencephalography (EEG) machine and monitor above the bed to detect activity in each research participant’s brain, via electrodes placed on the head. These measure not only activity in different regions of the brain but also eye movement.</p><p>In the control room researchers can see in real time which parts of each volunteer’s brain are being activated, for how long, and to what extent. It’s easy to tell when a volunteer is in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase. But more critical to Tamminen’s current research – and to sleep’s role in language development more generally – is a non-REM phase of deep sleep known as slow-wave sleep (SWS). This phase is important for forming and retaining memories, whether of vocabulary, grammar or other knowledge. The interaction of different parts of the brain is key here. During SWS the hippocampus, which is good at quick learning, is in constant communication with the neocortex to consolidate knowledge for long term recall. The neocortex is the part of the brain that is involved in higher-order brain functions. The hippocampus might initially encode a new word learned earlier that day, but to truly consolidate that knowledge, to link new information with existing information, to spot patterns and find connections with other ideas – the neocortical system needs to get involved.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.bbc.com)</i></p>",

        "text": "<p>Nearly 40% of UK greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the built environment, i.e. buildings, roads, parks, etc. This figure suggests that the design of buildings and the planning of cities can do much against climate crisis.</p><p>Architects like to think of themselves as public-spirited, well-intentioned people. The profession tends to attract people who want to change the world for the better. And what could matter more than the prevention of environmental and societal collapse? So what would architecture look like if all involved really and truly put climate at the centre of their concerns? Would there be no more concrete, given that the material has been fingered as particularly destructive? Or an end to towers covered with panels that have to be replaced every 30 years?</p><p>It is not enough to reduce what are called the “in-use” costs – heating, ventilation, lighting, water, waste, maintenance – but also the “embodied energy” that goes into construction and demolition: producing cement, steel and bricks, transporting materials, putting them in place, taking them down again and getting rid of them. There’s little point in building something that performs magnificently in use if it takes decades or centuries to pay back the cost of energy that went into its construction.</p><p>Painful choices may be required. It might mean some genuinely difficult dilemmas: concrete, if used properly, slows the rates at which a building cools down and warms up (good) but is made with cement, a material that single-handedly accounts for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions (not good). Sustainable design should ideally help buildings which are all-round better, longer-lasting, more pleasurable, more beautiful.</p><p>The architectural profession needs to reconsider its value systems: what is considered good and what bad. Architects are still trained from their student days to perform in a competitive and individualistic profession. They get more glory for designing a singular new building than they would if they worked out a good way of insulating old houses. Yet, as most of the building stock of the future is already with us, and as demolition and rebuilding goes with getting rid of whatever went into making the original building, the latter achievement is likely to be more useful than the former.</p><p>(The Guardian)</p>",

But the scooters’ popularity, and the relative lack of rules around their use, has prompted City Hall to impose overdue restrictions, with fines for driving them on the pavement or parking them in doorways, crosswalks and other busy places.</p><p>After scores of injuries, residents have been loudly complaining about the scooters, which are expected to number up to 40,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>From next month, a spot fine of 35 euros will be levied on bad parking, while those caught on the sidewalk will be hit with a 135-euro penalty. A speed limit of 20 km/h has been imposed across the capital.</p><p>Even before the legislation kicks in, police have been stepping up their efforts. More than 1,000 tickets have been issued and about 600 scooters seized, authorities said, and a new surveillance force has been set up. The scooters have been described as “anarchic”, and many people say “the law of the jungle” reigns in the city.</p><p>To regulate the number of scooters, City Hall has introduced a fee of 50 euros per scooter for the first 499 units, rising to 65 euros for companies operating more than 3,000. Despite the efforts to limit wild scooter riding, pedestrians remain skeptical. “The fines make sense, but can we enforce them and how?” asked Yuwei Yeh, a 47-year-old commercial retailer.</p><p>Karim Coulibaly, a 22-year-old employee with Lime, one of the scooter operators, said he thought the new laws would not limit the use of electric scooters, but that it was a good thing they are being moved off sidewalks and on to roads. He added that the company had introduced designated parking zones and had not seen a significant number of vehicles seized.</p><p>(reuters.com)</p>",

In 1836, when Turner exhibited his work at the Royal Academy, the Morning Post wrote: &quot;This amazing picture confounds all criticism: it is beyond praise.&quot; It later hung in the London home of Hugh Monro of Novar until his death, whereupon it was bought at auction by Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Roseberry.</p><p>The vast majority of Turner's output is currently housed in public galleries, after the artist bequeathed his collection to the nation on his death.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www. telegraph.co.uk)</i></p>",

        "text": "<p>In 1987, I was working with the photographer Adrian Arbib in the capital of West Papua. One morning I set off for a walk in the forest close to the town. It was a hot day and I soon took off my shirt and slung it over my shoulder. I followed a trail that took me down to a small stream. Halfway up the slope on the other side, I brushed against a rotten stump. I took another step and found myself under attack.</p><p>Giant hornets swarmed over my body, buzzing frantically. I knew how dangerous they were: plenty of people had died from their stings. I panicked. I was stung eight times ̶ I suspected I was as good as dead.</p><p>I stumbled across the clearing, shouting for help. I saw a rickety house. There was a man inside; I stepped forward and said: “Hello. I’m George. I’ve just been attacked by hundreds of insects.” The man’s mouth fell open; he didn’t seem to believe what I said.</p><p>Instead of <i>serangga</i> ̶ which means insects ̶ in my panic I’d said <i>semangka</i>; or watermelons. “I need help. I was attacked by watermelons. Eight of them bit me, eight watermelons.” He stared at me, his eyes becoming bigger and rounder. Then he suddenly smiled. “Ahh, <i>serangga</i>. You stay here, I have some medicine for you.”</p><p>I was going to be saved! These men lived with the hornets, didn’t they? They must have an antidote, refined over millennia from forest herbs. The man began to rub something in my back. It felt soothing, and the pain began to ebb. The smell of the medicine was strangely familiar.</p><p>I turned my head and saw in his hand a jar of VicksVapoRub, the ointment I sometimes use for mosquito bites. “No, no! I’m going to die!” I cried and ran from the room. Just before I reached the town, the convulsions began. I stumbled along the streets, shuddering, holding on to buildings to stay upright. I fell through the door of the hotel and into the room, where Adrian was sitting on his bed, reading.</p><p>I tried to speak, but my mouth didn’t seem to work. I fell face down onto my bed, shivering violently. He must have noticed the welts on my back, because he forced a couple of antihistamines down me. The fit began to subside.

However, unlike that hijacking, in an incident on Friday that involved a Libyan Airways plane, the two hijackers surrendered peacefully to police. Officials said the <i>Entebbe</i> film was just being shot at Malta International Airport, but the crew had to halt filming on the airport grounds when the Libyan plane landed there. The domestic flight with 118 people on board had taken off from Sabha and had been bound direct for the Libyan capital Tripoli.</p><p>The head of airport security said that the Maltese armed forces were well able to cope with such events. &quot;We've had five hijackings landing here and ironically today they were actually filming Entebbe on the airport grounds - and that had to be stopped,&quot; she told the BBC. The Friday hijacking ended peacefully. However, in Uganda in 1976 the hostage situation dragged on for about a week after Palestinian hostage-takers hijacked the flight from Tel Aviv to Paris and diverted it to <i>Entebbe</i>. The Air France plane had 250 passengers – many of whom were Israeli – and 12 crew. The hijackers demanded the release of 54 militants held by Israel and four other countries and a $5million ransom.</p><p>In one of the most daring operations in its history, Israel secretly sent a unit of elite commandos - led by Yonatan Netanyahu, the brother of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - to rescue the hostages. They flew eight-and-a-half-hours over 4,000km, through hostile territory and beneath the scope of enemy radar, to carry out a surprise raid. The commandos killed all the hostage-takers as well as 20 Ugandan troops before flying the freed passengers and crew back to Israel. Three hostages lost their lives in the operation, as well as Yonatan Netanyahu, the only fatality among the troops.</p><p>(reuters.com)</p>",

The ceremonial staff, a long black stick made of ebony with a golden lion at the top, is used to knock three times on the door to gain admittance.</p><p>Black Rod also organises other ceremonial events and is responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order in the Lords Chamber. Apart from the doorkeepers to the Chamber, the House of Lord’s department also includes Black Rod’s deputy, the Yeoman Usher.</p><p>Before organising the Wimbledon championships, Clarke worked for the 2012 Olympic Games, the London marathon and UK sport. She said she was “deeply honoured and delighted” to be offered the post. “I am truly looking forward to starting work.”</p><p>The Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, said: “The Lords has a great record of women taking on senior political roles. Five of the last seven leaders of the Lords and the current leader of the opposition have been women, as well as both my predecessors.”</p><p>(<i>The Guardian Weekly</i>)</p>",

He also discusses his interest in history, and shares what readers can look forward to in future instalments, following the recently-released new volume of the series, <i>The Icebound Land</i>.</p><p><b>Sarah Wood</b>: Slavery is an important plot element to <i>The Icebound Land</i>. Why did you make it a main plot point?</p><p><b>John Flanagan</b>: The concept of having slaves was pretty commonplace during the Middle Ages. But I’m not sure I’d agree that slavery is a main plot element. I think the drug addict storyline is much stronger.</p><p><b>SW</b>: Evanlyn learns so much during the course of the book. Can you talk a little about her?</p><p><b>JF</b>: I love Evanlyn and I love her role in this book. It’s far too easy to have a female character who exists solely for the purpose of being rescued by the hero. In spite of her privileged upbringing, Evanlyn has a core of steel and a courageous and practical spirit. As times get tough, that inner strength becomes more apparent and she tries to accomplish things for which she has little or no training, and her persistence helps her to succeed.</p><p><b>SW</b>: One of the things I really enjoyed about the previous volume, <i>The Burning Bridge</i>, was your vivid descriptions of combat and fighting techniques. Readers could practically reconstruct the fights from your descriptions.</p><p><b>JF</b>: I appreciate your saying that the battle scenes are vivid. It’s what I try to achieve when describing a battle or a single combat. And some years ago I was a keen participant in archery, along with my son Mike, so I know a bit about the subject.</p><p><b>SW</b>: The world of the <i>Ranger’s Apprentice</i> seems to be very clearly based on the geography and history of our world. Is there any reason you decided to base your fantasy world on a European model?</p><p><b>JF</b>: Well, I could hardly base it on an American or Australian medieval model because nobody really knows what was going on in either of these two countries at that time. I’m more familiar with European history, so I’m more comfortable with that setting.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(https://www.kidsreads.com)</i></p><p><h3>SUMMARY</h3></p><p>In this (0) for Kidsreads.com, conducted by Sarah Wood, John Flanagan says that he started Ranger’s Apprentice in the hope of making his son more interested in (10). Wood met Flanagan shortly after the (11) of The Icebound Land. Flanagan says that although (12) plays a large part in his new book, the central theme is (13). Talking about the characters he says he didn’t want (14) to have only a passive role. In the reporter’s opinion in The Burning Bridge, the previous volume in the (15), fights and battles are presented in a particularly lifelike manner.

In her book, she reported (19) to lock users into a cycle of addiction. “In the online economy, profit depends on continuous consumer attention – (20).” Whether it’s Snapchat streaks, Facebook photo-scrolling, or playing CandyCrush, Schüll explained, you get drawn into repeated cycles of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback – and the rewards are just enough to keep you going.</p><p>Like gambling, (21) and makes people more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, social media use has been linked to depression.

That four-wheeled metal box, which may well be equipped with every technological innovation imaginable, now shows distinct signs of being on the decline.</p><p>After a century in which the car has sat at the heart of industrial civilisation, the age of the automobile ‒ of mass vehicle ownership, and the idea (in the western world at least) that life is not complete without your own set of wheels ‒ looks to be drawing to a close.</p><p>The sale of diesel and petrol cars is to be outlawed in the UK from 2040. Oxford has announced that it is set to be the first British city to ban all petrol and diesel cars and vans ‒ from a handful of central streets first, extending to the entire urban centre by 2030.</p><p>General Motors has announced that it will soon begin testing autonomous cars in the challenging conditions of New York City, apparently the latest step in the company’s move towards building a fleet of self-driving taxis.</p><p>I am aware that the idea that we will soon surrender our vehicles can look far-fetched. But deep social trends do point in this direction. In 1994 75% of 21-to-29-year-olds had driving licences. By 2016 this figure had dropped to 66%. If you buy most of your stuff online, the need to drive to a shopping centre dwindles to nothing; if you keep in touch with distant friends and family online, might a time-consuming visit to see them feel a bit less urgent? The need and therefore the demand for car ownership is bound to decline. Also, the rising global emergency focused on fatal levels of air pollution confirms the motor industry’s catastrophic environmental impacts.</p><p>The prospects are amazing.

        "text": "<p>&quot;A successful career? Children? Perfect hair? I don't know how he does it...&quot; said no one, ever. The idea that men might have to juggle to maintain that precious work/life balance is rarely talked about. Which is why a parody Twitter account – Man Who Has It All – has hit such a nerve.</p><p>The Man is a &quot;working dad&quot; (now there's a phrase you don't hear every day) dishing out 140- character nuggets of advice for &quot;man juggling a successful career and fatherhood&quot;. By flipping genders, he reveals how ludicrous the tips offered by women's mags and lifestyle blogs are: &quot;Dad with a career? Beat stress by stacking on veggies, teaming up with other dads & dressing for your face shape&quot;. He also highlights the sexism in statements that are supposedly supportive of women, but which would never be said of a man: &quot;CONGRATULATIONS to all male EU leaders for getting there on merit alone. Very well done all of you.&quot; But he's best when he skewers comments many women make about their other halves: &quot;My wife is very much a 'HANDS-ON-MUM'. I'm so lucky. She even changed their nappies when they were little.&quot;</p><p>The Man Who Has It All (pictured) reveals that a gender bias in childcare and housework remains. Women are the main breadwinners in four homes out of 10, yet we are a long way off domestic democracy. Seventy per cent of all housework in the UK is done by women and middle-class men are most reluctant to lift a finger (or duster).</p><p>&quot;Women are still working what Arkie Hochschild called &quot;The second shift&quot; back in 1989,&quot; explains occupational psychologist Almuth McDonall. &quot;I expected the gender difference to be smaller in couples where both partners worked full-time, but it was even bigger. I think this is because the working mothers felt guilty, so they had to do even more.&quot;</p><p>So who is this mysterious man? In his bio he claims to be a &quot;frazzled working dad with a wife and three kids who spends his 'me time' on Twitter.&quot; When asked for an interview for this newspaper, he said he was &quot;too busy juggling savoury yoghurts, kids' sportswear, healthy- looking skin, a career & pasta salads&quot; to answer my questions.</p><p>The Man Who Has It All says: &quot;If I can help one man stay hydrated, I'll be a happy man&quot;, but maybe it's more than a joke. If the popularity of this account encourages one father to step up his share of childcare, or challenges one woman to realise she might not be &quot;very lucky&quot; to have a man who &quot;helps with the kids on weekends&quot;, then we might all be &quot;#Blessed&quot;.</p><p>(<i>The Independent</i>)</p>",

        "text": "<p>There have been many baffling food trends over the past couple of years, but none is quite so odd as the comeback of mead. I say comeback, but that suggests mead had slipped off the radar for a couple of years. In fact, the last time the drink was truly fashionable was in the 9th century. Mead, made using fermented honey, is probably the oldest known alcoholic drink, whose origins stretch back 9,000 years. It is referenced in Chaucer and frequently in the old English epic poem <i>Beowulf</i>, where Viking warriors tended to go looting and burning villages after getting drunk in the mead hall.</p><p>But after a good 600 years of falling off drinks menus in taverns in favour of beer and wine, mead is back with a zing. According to the American Mead Makers Association, sales went up 42 per cent last year. In the UK, Cornish Mead said sales had gone up 15 per cent in recent weeks alone.</p><p>Various people have suggested that <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the cultish television programme set in the futuristic and yet medieval kingdoms of Westeros and Eosos, is responsible. The characters certainly drown goblets of intoxicating liquor, but mead is never actually mentioned in the programme or in the original <i>Game of Thrones</i> books.</p><p>The cause of mead's sudden popularity are hipsters, those bearded young urbanites who, having helped launch cereal-only cafés, have found mead as the next novelty drink after craft beer. In the endless quest for the new, mead is a perfect candidate with its unique flavour of fermented honey.</p><p>Mead's cause has also been helped by a general move towards &quot;authenticity&quot; in food and drink. People are far more interested in traditional methods of food production, which also explains the rise of sourdough bread and the whole slow food movement. At various real ale festivals there are now dedicated mead bars, displaying a wide range of this low-alcohol drink from the sickly sweet to the semi-dry.</p><p>(<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>)</p>",

Yet it was still possible their uncle, Richard III, who had seized the throne, would spare them. The princes were so very young, and if it was accepted that they were illegitimate, as their uncle claimed, they would pose little threat.</p><p>The innocent Richard, Duke of York, only nine years old, remained &quot;joyous&quot; and full of &quot;frolics&quot;, even as the last of their servants were dismissed. But the boys were spotted behind the Tower windows less and less often, and by the summer's end they had vanished without a trace.</p><p>It is the fact of their disappearance that lies at the heart of many conspiracy theories over what happened to the princes. Murder was suspected, but without bodies no one could be certain even that they were dead. Many different scenarios have been put forward in the years since. In the nearest surviving contemporary accounts, Richard III is accused of ordering their deaths, the boys having been either suffocated or drowned. Other theories suggested that one or both of the princes escaped.</p><p>In more modern times, some have come to believe that Richard III was innocent of ordering the children's death, and instead spirited his nephews abroad or to a safe place nearer home, only for them to be killed later by Henry VII, who feared the boys' rival claims to the throne. None of these theories, however, has provided a satisfactory answer to the difficult problem at the heart of this mystery: the fact that the boys simply vanished.</p><p>Henry VIII's chancellor, Thomas More, claimed he had been told the murdered boys were buried at the foot of some stairs in the Tower. In 1676, long after the passing of the Tudor dynasty, two skeletons, judged to be of young children, were recovered in the Tower, in a place that resembled More's description of the princes' first burial place. They were then interred at Westminster Abbey, not far from where Henry VII lies.</p><p>(<i>BBC History Magazine</i>)</p><p><h3>SUMMARY</h3></p><p>12-year-old Edward V had every reason to fear (0) as it was not unusual at the time for deposed monarchs to be (22).

        "text": "<p>On 26 September 1983 the world was saved from potential nuclear disaster.</p><p>In the early hours of the morning, the Soviet Union's early-warning systems signalled an incoming missile strike from the United States. Computer readouts suggested several missiles had been launched. The protocol for the Soviet military would have been to strike back with a nuclear attack of its own.</p><p>But duty officer Stanislav Petrov ̶ whose job it was to register enemy missile launches ̶ decided it was a false alert and did not report it to his commanders. His decision may have saved the world from a nuclear war.</p><p>Mr Petrov, who is retired now and lives in a small town near Moscow, was part of a well-trained team which served at one of the Soviet Union's early warning bases, not far from Moscow. His job was to register any missile strikes and to report them to the Soviet military and political leadership.</p><p>But when the moment came, he almost froze in place. &quot;The siren howled, but I just sat there for a few seconds, staring at the big, red screen with the word 'missile launch' on it,&quot; he told our reporter. &quot;A minute later the siren went off again. The second missile was launched. Then the third, and the fourth, and the fifth. Computers changed their alerts from 'launch' to 'missile strike',&quot; he says.</p><p>Although the alert seemed absolutely reliable, Mr Petrov had some doubts. Alongside IT specialists, like him, the Soviet Union had other experts, also watching America's missile forces. A group of satellite radar operators told him they had registered no missiles. But those people were only a support service. The responsibility was his.</p><p>Instead of raising the alarm Mr Petrov called headquarters and reported a system error. If he was wrong, the first nuclear explosions would have happened minutes later. But nothing happened.</p><p>Mr Petrov says he was the only officer in his team who had received a civilian education. &quot;My colleagues were all professional soldiers, they were taught to give and obey orders,&quot; he told us. So, he believes, if somebody else had been on shift, the alarm would have been raised.</p><p>He kept silent for 10 years. But, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the story did get into the press. Mr Petrov received several international awards. But he does not think of himself as a hero. &quot;That was my job,&quot; he says.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.bbc.com)</i></p>",

In addition to the immediate impacts of jet lag: difficulties sleeping or staying awake, there are also worrying longer-term consequences that depend on the frequency of your travel, like greater sensibility to infection.</p><p>The good news is that experts say simply being aware of the impact and making small changes to your travel habits can help boost mental energy.</p><p><h4>Get in the zone</h4></p><p>With jet lag, when there are sudden, large shifts in external time, our internal timing system uses environmental cues, like the presence or absence of daylight.</p><p>In order to stay one step ahead, anticipate the change to your natural rhythms by adjusting your body clock in advance. Reset your watch at the beginning of your journey to the time zone of your destination. Depending on whether you’re flying east or west, you’ll want to try and expose yourself to additional light in the morning or evening a few days before flying.</p><p><h4>Skip the crisps</h4></p><p>Many travellers end up eating unhealthy meals when they are on the move, but it’s essential to eat properly. Choosing the right meals at the right time of day can help readjust your natural rhythms quicker. To reset your body’s rhythm, try avoiding food on the flight until breakfast in the new time zone.</p><p><h4>Get moving</h4></p><p>If you feel sleepy during daylight hours when you first arrive somewhere new, try and do some aerobics. Even if you do not feel tired in the evening, try to sleep anyway. And avoid drinking a coffee when you hit that wall in the afternoon. Caffeine will only make the process much harder when it’s time for bed. Smartphone use before bed is the ultimate no-no. The blue light emitted from it can trick your brain into thinking it’s daytime and therefore block the production of the hormone melatonin, which would normally help you sleep.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

The exchange of gifts is commonplace on such trips abroad, but cultural norms differ from country to country, and Baroness Kramer was breaking a local norm.</p><p>Giving a clock to someone in Chinese culture is a bad omen, suggesting they are running out of time. The mayor laughed off the incident with a joke, while Baroness Kramer apologised, saying &quot;we learn something new every day.&quot; It appears her office may not have read Debrett's, the etiquette guide, which advises readers to &quot;do some research to avoid making a basic error – the bottle of whisky to the teetotaller, or the chocolate to the dieter.&quot;</p><p>William Hanson, an etiquette expert, says that most diplomatic gifts are agreed between both parties in advance – and regardless, &quot;research should be done.&quot;</p><p>Baroness Kramer's mistake is not rare – navigating the cultural minefield can be difficult for diplomats and business executives. One culture's prized gift can be another's cause for grave offence. A ceremonial sword in some parts of Africa is a symbol of power; in Switzerland it would be a sign of aggression.</p><p>Some things are common, though. Almost all cultural taboos revolve around death, regardless of location. The number four is considered bad luck in China, because it tonally sounds like death, while the number eight is good, because it sounds similar to the word for wealth.</p><p>In the UK, knives are generally not given as presents because superstition says they could cut through a friendship. A bunch of chrysanthemums are a no-go area for the Spanish, because they are associated with death, much in the same way as you wouldn't present a bunch of white lilies to a Briton.</p><p>Indeed, flowers are a particularly troublesome area. Red roses – a traditional lovers' gift – would be out of place at a business meeting, while yellow roses commonly suggest infidelity in France, and death in Mexico. And superstition suggests you should always give an odd number of flowers – but not 13.</p><p>As for a foolproof gift to present to a colleague that's guaranteed not to offend, regardless of where in the world you give it, Hanson has one suggestion: &quot;Books are much safer.

It's called a pyramid writing style but it's easier to think of it as an upside down triangle with the point at the bottom and the flat edge at the top.</p><p>With news or short non-fiction writing, the flat edge is your start and the point is your end.</p><p>With an inverted pyramid, you start with your entire news story in the first paragraph. If someone only reads that, they must still get the whole story. For an example, look at any newspaper and especially at breaking news stories. The first paragraph gives you all the essential facts, and each successive paragraph is less and less important.</p><p>Pyramid writing was allegedly invented to solve a specific technological problem that faced newspapers in their earliest days.</p><p>Writers would type their stories on paper and send them via the editor to the composing team. Designers there would use scissors to trim the paper and then assemble all the stories on one larger piece. This was genuine cutting and pasting and it is where we get that term from.</p><p>Every writer would have been given a length to write to and probably every writer exceeded it. But even if they all wrote exactly to the length they were given, a late piece of news would break that was more urgent and had to go on the front page.</p><p>Then the other stories would hang over the bottom of the page and there was no option: the composing designers had to physically chop the end off. This always happened at the last minute, it was always up against print deadlines, so there was never time to have great editorial debates about where exactly to cut.</p><p>So we got the pyramid idea. If you write in this manner, then a designer can slap your copy on the page and, without even reading it, know where to cut. The ideal is to keep the complete story but they know they can simply chop off the last paragraph. And then the one before that. And the one before that.</p><p>If they end up with just a headline and one single paragraph, the story still works. It was a straight technical requirement but the result is the core style of every printed newspaper you've ever read.</p><p>(<i>UK Writing Magazine</i>)</p>",

It keeps on repelling dirt even after being rubbed with sandpaper or scratched with a knife.</p><p>Studies show that surfaces that have been coated with the titanium-dioxide paint become super-repellent to water and oil, with liquid forming spheres that simply roll away, carrying dust and dirt with them.</p><p>Clothing soaked in the water-repellent liquid effectively becomes waterproof and tests have shown that inky stains can simply be shaken off the fabrics.</p><p>&quot;Being waterproof allows materials to self-clean as water forms ball-shaped droplets that roll over the surface, acting like miniature vacuum-cleaners picking up dirt, viruses and bacteria along the way,&quot; said Yao Lu, a member of the research team at University College London.</p><p>Details of the self-cleaning coating were published last night in the journal Science by a team led by Professor Ivan Parkin, head of chemistry at UCL.

        "text": "<p>On the face of it, Dylan Redford has everything going for him − he is a handsome, intelligent and artistic 22-year-old who happens to be the grandson of Robert Redford, world-famous actor and director. But he is also severely dyslexic and, at the age of 10, could barely read or write.</p><p>At school in Marin County, California, he found it impossible to use the lockers. The combination of remembering a sequence of numbers and then twisting the padlock dial in the right direction proved difficult to master. &quot;I had to ask my friends to do it for me,&quot; says Dylan. Dylan's experiences with dyslexia are depicted in a new documentary, The Big Picture, directed by Dylan's father, James. After watching his &quot;intellectually curious son&quot; struggle with dyslexia throughout much of his childhood, James Redford, the eldest surviving child of Robert, says his ambition was simple. He wanted &quot;to make the movie I wish my family could have seen&quot;.</p><p>The Big Picture, which is to be released in the UK later this month after getting excellent reviews in the US, follows the stories of several dyslexics of different ages, including Dylan, and examines how people with the condition cope from a young age right through adulthood.</p><p>Among the interviewees are prominent lawyers, bankers and chief executives. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, talks candidly on camera about his own dyslexia, admitting that someone once had to explain to him the difference between &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;net&quot; profit after a board meeting.</p><p>Dyslexia is a persistent condition consisting of a combination of abilities and difficulties. According to the Dyslexia Research Trust it it the most common cause of childhood loss of confidence, sometimes leading to frustration and depression. Yet the condition is still shrouded in mystery. When Dylan was a child, most people still assumed it was a &quot;made-up&quot; illness that children could grow out of.</p><p>The Big Picture explores some recent scientific research around dyslexia which has used brain imaging to demonstrate that shrinkage in the part of brain that processes word sounds and language could be one of the condition's contributory factors.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The Observer&#41;</i></p>",

There were moments now, more and more of them, when I didn't care about the things that happened, who they happened to.</p><p>And so it was time to go. I couldn't just walk away. I offered the men a deal. I would stay as long as they did. Sue, the education manager, finally agreed to let the class run down, no more new faces.</p><p>By that time there were only four members in the group and, out of the blue, there was a run of golden, other-worldly mornings when we read Chaucer. Chaucer. They couldn't get enough of the Canterbury Tales, that lovely run of characters. The men's enthusiasm reassured me that I hadn't wasted my time. What, after all, does education offer to people if not a greater sense of being human? When we don't know about history and art and society we are adrift, lost. Many of the men I taught were ignorant of just about everything, and as grown men they felt this keenly. Education was a relief, a route to self-respect.</p><p>Then three of the men were released and it was just me and Casey. We decided to do quantum physics, and for a few months we followed a course of lectures on CD. I found it hard going, but in fact his maths turned out to be better than mine and he helped me to understand things. I know that I tried his patience, making him go over things three or four times, but he was a good teacher.</p><p>One afternoon, Sue rang me up. &quot;Casey was released yesterday.&quot; And I was finished.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The Guardian&#41;</i></p>",

And high heels don't tend to be very comfortable. It is almost as though they weren't designed for walking in.</p><p>Originally, they weren't. The high heel was worn for centuries throughout the Near East as a form of riding footwear. Good horsemanship was essential to the fighting styles of Persia – the historical name for modern-day Iran. When a soldier stood up in his stirrups, the heels helped him to secure his stance so that he could use his bow and arrow more effectively.</p><p>At the end of the 16th century, the Persian Shah was keen to forge links with rulers in Europe. So he sent a diplomatic mission to the courts of Russia, Germany and Spain. A wave of interest in all things Persian passed through Western Europe, and Persian-style shoes were enthusiastically adopted by aristocrats.</p><p>In the muddy streets of 17th century Europe, these new shoes had no utility value whatsoever – but that was the point. The upper classes have always used impractical, uncomfortable and luxurious clothing to announce their privileged status. Louis XIV of France, who stood 1.63m, supplemented his height by a further 10cm with heels.</p><p>The heels and soles were always red – the dye was expensive and carried a martial overtone. The fashion soon spread overseas – Charles II of England's coronation portrait of 1661 features him wearing a pair of enormous red, French-style heels – although he was over 1.85m to begin with.</p><p>In the 18th century the Enlightenment brought with it a new respect for the rational and useful, and men's fashion shifted towards more practical clothing. High heels came to be seen as foolish and effeminate. By 1740 men had stopped wearing them altogether.</p><p>(bbc.com)</p>",

Also, someone took some Lego pieces to a beachcombers' fair in the United States (13).

He was swept past familiar buildings and eventually bumped into a coconut tree. &quot;When I looked up, I saw a young boy clinging on the tree. I was afraid the rising water would soon reach him, so I told him to climb down, hang on to the wood, hold on tight and never let it go.&quot;</p><p>The trick was balancing their makeshift raft.

They did not know where they were, what direction they were travelling in, or how long they were there for.

Macartney's <i>Hungary: A Short History</i> &#40;Edinburgh, 1962&#41;. It is also the first history of Hungary to be written by an author who had been British Ambassador to that country, had witnessed the events which he records in the book's closing chapters, and had known many of the Hungarians who took part in them. Sir Bryan Cartledge first came to Hungary in the 1970s and served as British ambassador to Hungary in 1980-83. He holds diplomas in the Hungarian language from the University of Westminster (UK) and University of Debrecen (Hungary), and is thoroughly familiar with great works of Hungarian literature, having read most in the original.</p><p>The book combines narrative with analysis and comment and covers the political, economic, social and cultural history of Hungary from the westward migration of the Magyar tribes and their occupation of the Carpathian Basin to the entry of a democratic Hungarian state into the NATO Alliance and the European Union. No previous history written from the perspective of a non-Hungarian has attempted such a comprehensive approach, which balances accounts of the tragedies which have befallen this small nation with appreciation of its cultural achievements. <i>The Will to Survive</i> should become the standard history of Hungary in English, to be read both for general interest and for reference.</p><p>Described as &quot;the best history of Hungary in the English language&quot; by the eminent Hungarian-American historian John Lukacs, <i>The Will to Survive</i> is deeply researched and beautifully written.

        "text": "<p>In January 2014 an Arctic freeze swept across North America, bringing temperatures as low as -40°C with wind chill in some cities. What are the risks of extreme cold and how can you avoid them?</p><p>Plummeting temperatures and icy winds present two main dangers: hypothermia, in which your body shuts down after reaching an abnormally low temperature, and frostbite. This latter is most common on limbs, but can also affect eyelashes.</p><p>Sitting out a cold snap indoors, with plentiful stocks of food, water and medicine, is one possible solution. Taps can be kept open at a drip to stop pipes freezing. Pets can be brought inside.</p><p>Many schools and offices in the worst affected areas are closed. But those still needing to make essential trips are advised to wear several layers of loose-fitting clothing and a tightly woven outer layer. Mittens are warmer than gloves. Hand or foot warmers can be placed inside a glove or inside a boot, though these may not heat the tips of fingers or toes.</p><p>Goggles or glasses can help keep the temperature around the eyes stable, says John Stone of Survival Systems in Halifax, Canada, though eyelashes are only likely to freeze together if they're wet. Eyeballs, he says, are likely to be fine in these temperatures.</p><p>Earrings and facial jewellery should be removed, Mr. Stone added. &quot;The temperature of the metal is going to become very cold very quickly, much more quickly than the skin temperature.&quot;</p><p>According to our Canadian expert, caffeine and alcohol cause your body to lose heat more rapidly. It's best to seek shelter if you feel your body temperature dropping. Chicago, where temperatures dropped to -27°C in 2014, extended the opening hours at warming centres across the city.</p><p>Vehicles, like homes, should be well-stocked with emergency supplies. While petrol freezes at about -60°C, diesel can clog at -10°C and needs to be &quot;winter-weighted&quot;. Tyres can freeze solid, which makes for a bumpy start to a journey but is unlikely to damage them, says John Stone. &quot;It's like driving a Fred Flintstone-mobile.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

Billy Ray Harris, another homeless man was able to buy himself a house with the money given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year.</p><p>The release of the Jim Wolf video – timed to coincide with Veterans Day – has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as &quot;pretty incredible&quot; – far outperforming any other content he has produced. &quot;The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be.

        "textTitle": "COVER THE BASICS",
        "example": "The reader's reaction to a book cover is of great importance.",
        "text": "<p>Whether you're publishing in print or electronically, your cover must make the right impression on readers.</p><p>One of the most commonly asked questions on writers' forums these days is: 'How do I create my own book cover?' The simple answer is that if you have to ask that question, then maybe you should consider getting a professional to do it. No matter how good your writing, a good cover is essential to getting decent sales. It is the first thing your potential readers see and an unprofessional job could send them looking for a different book. Often, though, finances are tight.</p><p>Whether you are designing the cover yourself or hiring someone who knows what they're doing, there are some essential points to consider in getting the best design for your book.</p><p><h4>Show or tell?</h4></p><p>What is the cover of your book there to do? On a print copy, of course, you could say that it's there to protect the book as well as to sell it, but with ebooks, the sole reason for a 'cover' is to grab the attention of the potential reader. At the same time, there is no need for overkill. Chip Kidd, the New York book designer famed for the silhouette T-Rex on the cover of the book Jurassic Park (which was later used as an icon for the movie), says, 'A book designer gives form to content but also manages a careful balance between the two.' In essence, he says, the cover is there to tell everyone 'what the story is like'. If your title tells the reader what the book is about ̶ eg. Murder on Smith Street ̶ it is treating your potential audience with contempt to then have a picture of a dead body next to a sign saying 'Smith Street'.</p><p><h4>Don't try to tell the whole story</h4></p><p>One common cover design error is particularly difficult for authors to overcome: they know their own books too well.</p><p>As a result of this, many try to include as much as they can on the cover. This does not sell books. Firstly, the reader is overwhelmed by the confusion and secondly, what may seem like a really important part of your story to you, may mean nothing to a reader before they have read the book. Choose one or two salient points from your story to include and keep it simple. You need to create an emotion in the reader that makes them want to read the book, not tell them what the book is all about.</p><p><h4>Show your genre/tone</h4></p><p>What images come to mind when you think 'thriller'? Obviously, a pretty vase of flowers is not going to grab you if you're a thriller fan. Break the vase and maybe have a bullet lying in amongst the bent flowers, with blood in place of spilled water, and you have a different cover altogether. It's about giving the reader an idea.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;Writing Magazine&#41;</i></p>",

Horses pulling heavy loads have disappeared, and most people would argue that the black cab does a far better job than the hansom cab* ever did. But statues of kings atop their horses take pride of place in squares and parks, and the more recent Animals in War memorial on Park Lane is a reminder that our dependence on horses lasted until less than a century ago.</p><p>Not all of the reminders are visual, either. Streets called mews used to have rows of stables in them, and in central London mews houses, i.e. converted stables, sell for several million pounds each today. Not all London mews have changed, though. Bathurst Mews is one of the last to still house horses; it is home to Hyde Park Stables. The prices for riding lessons are fairly steep, but just think: as everyone else walks gloomily along Oxford Street, you could be trotting purposefully around the park. The pace might be a bit leisurely for the experienced rider, but in terms of location, you simply can't beat it.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you're keen to ride through rolling hills, then Richmond Park is just the place. Stag Lodge Stables, for example, are based just off the A3, and as well as offering lessons, in summer they also offer pub rides. A pony and a pint? Sounds like heaven!</p><p>If you're a polo enthusiast, London offers a quick fix for that as well; Ham Polo Club is just a short journey from the centre of town, while Windsor (a 40-minute drive from London) offers some of the best polo in the UK.

We offer platitudes (&quot;Time heals all wounds&quot;) or advice (&quot;You'll feel better if you exercise&quot;).</p><p>Emotional support from friends and family can be an essential element in the healing process, but it isn't easy to know what to say. Don't wait for your friend to reach out to you. Start by asking the person how they are doing. Listen to what they have to say. A depressed person wants most of all to be heard, respected and gently loved, and they want to be reassured that the friend isn't going to leave. Offer to talk, but don't pressure. Think of yourself as a 'distraction' – someone to have fun with. Be gently hopeful without claiming that everything is going to be better overnight. Avoid saying things that minimise their pain. That includes: &quot;Stop feeling sorry for yourself.&quot; &quot;There are people worse off,&quot; or &quot;You need a hobby.&quot; These are all proven losers that the depressed person will see as blaming or hostile.</p><p>Simple, clear messages work best. Say, &quot;I'm sorry that you're in so much pain, and I want you to know that I am here for you for as long as it takes.&quot; This can go a long way toward helping your friend feel less isolated.</p><p>As for my dive buddy, the day after our conversation I wrote him a note to say I was sorry he'd hit a rough patch and that I was a 'good ear'. I also offered to go diving with him. His response? &quot;Thanks, Elizabeth. That's really cool.&quot;</p><p>(wttp://online.wsj.com)</p>",

One of the prizes went to a Japanese team, who measured the friction of banana skin in the lab, and showed why apple and orange peel are not quite so hazardous.</p><p>The Kitasato University group received the physics Ig for their insights. Ridiculous as this may seem, when you delve deeper, you will see a serious intention. The Japanese scientists are interested in how friction and lubrication affect the movement of our limbs. They have found that the molecular gels that give banana skins their slippery properties are also there in our bodies, for example, knees, where our bones meet.</p><p>Another winner this year was the study that examined the brains of people who see the face of Jesus and other figures on slices of toast. Kang Lee, from the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues showed their subjects pictures of &quot;noise&quot; - the random marks you see on a piece of toast - to see what patterns they would identify. The tendency to see order in randomness - like a face in the charred areas of a piece of bread - is a well-established psychological phenomenon.</p><p>Using MRI, Lee and his team saw how the same parts of the brain light up when we see non-existent faces as when we see real ones.</p><p>&quot;Interestingly, when you superimpose all the noise images where these people say they see faces, and remove all the noise images in which they told us they couldn't see faces, a face does actually show up,&quot; Prof Lee said. The Toronto scientist explained that this type of pattern recognition was hard-wired, and even chimps experienced it.</p><p>&quot;The face you are going to see is determined by your personal expectations or beliefs,&quot; he added. &quot;So, for example, Buddhists will not see Jesus on toast, but rather Buddha.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

        "text": "<p>In the Hungarian capital, tourists are lining up to ... escape from a room. We look at a growing trend</p><p>Viktor Oszvald got the idea for Budapest's top tourist activity while juggling dressed as a clown. His daughter had just been born and that evening, while working at a horror-themed show in a suburban factory, he dreamt of breaking free and had a brainwave.</p><p>Now Oszvald is founder of Claustrophilia, TripAdvisor's* top-ranked thing to do in Budapest, and part of a tourist craze sweeping Europe: room escape games. Essentially live-action puzzles, the games combine riddles and physical tasks, with the aim being to, well, escape from a room.</p><p>Teams of up to five usually get an hour to make a successful exit, paying between £13 and £30 depending on the game. Few succeed. Since late 2012 Claustrophilia has been &quot;beaten&quot; by about a dozen teams unaided, of the many hundreds Oswald claims have played. He sometimes takes pity on contenders and shouts out hints via a speaker.</p><p>Claustrophilia is one of over 30 escape games to have cropped up in the city since 2011. Some, like the popular TRAP, use imagery from the likes of ancient Egypt and medieval Europe. ParaPark's dank setting could have been lifted straight from Saw the horror movie said to have partly spurred escape games' popularity. Other influences include TV shows like Survivor, but most claim the format emerged from point-and-click PC games of the early 1990s.</p><p>Claustrophilia's backstory is the enigmatic will of an old eccentric to explain the cramped assortment of props and furniture ̵ ranging from gas masks to 19th century maps. It's spooky but never scary, and held in an apartment within a disused building (the precise location is shared only upon booking).</p><p>Like the famous ruin pubs, escape games have flourished in Budapest, thanks to the many pretty-but-dilapidated apartment blocks that owe much to a violent, tragic past, wedged between fascism and communism.</p><p>Buoyed by their success, many games companies are now branching out, eyeing several destinations in western Europe. Meanwhile, the games' popularity at home continues to soar. Most people come to Budapest for the architecture or the nightlife. But now, many are coming simply to escape.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.theguardian.com)</i></p><p style='font-size:small'>* TripAdvisor: a travel website</p>",

But the rhythm of their actual days will be much the same as when their parents and grandparents sat in those same seats back in the 20th century.</p><p>During class time, the teacher will stand at the front of the room and hold forth on the day’s topic. Then, as the period ends, he or she will give students a clutch of work to do at home.</p><p>But one American teacher is taking a different approach. Karl Fisch, a teacher of algebra at a high school in Denver, Colorado, has flipped the sequence. He’s recorded his lectures on video and uploaded them to YouTube for his students to watch at home. Then, in class, he works with students as they solve problems and experiment with the concepts. Lectures at home, “homework” in the classroom. Call it the Fisch Flip.</p><p>The Fisch Flip offers a lesson in innovation for organisations of every kind. Consider the publishing industry. It is typical for publishers to launch a book by issuing a pricey hardcover, and then, after a year or so, following it up with a less expensive paperback. Flipping the sequence, i.e. putting out a cheap paperback or even an e-book first makes a lot of sense. Readers are more likely to gamble on an unknown author if they can risk just a few pounds. Then, if the book sells well, the publisher could produce a hardcover edition at a much higher price.</p><p>Or imagine flipping the sequence in the movie business. Contrary to the current strategy, studios could first issue a low-price DVD to build an audience. If the film proved popular, the studio could then release it to the movie theatres.</p><p>Even the human resources department is a candidate for the Fisch Flip.

At a council meeting last night, Luigi Bobbio, the recently elected mayor, won a vote to ban clothing considered &quot;very short&quot; from the town. Police will have the power to hand out €300 fines to offenders.</p><p>Explaining what he meant by &quot;very short&quot;, Bobbio said officers would target women wearing miniskirts that did not fully cover their underwear. He said he had faith in officers to make snap decisions. &quot;They won't need to carry out checks up close,&quot; Bobbio told the Corriere del Mezzogiorno. &quot;One glance will be enough to decide.&quot;</p><p>The new rules, which were approved by the town council yesterday, drew outrage from local opposition politicians, who mounted a sit-in outside the town hall. &quot;The Bobbio administration is male chauvinist,&quot; the organisers of the protest said in a statement. &quot;This town does need decorum, but not the decorum that is measured by a tape measure held against women's clothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By equating women's clothing with urban decorum, this measure implies women are no more than benches or hedges,&quot; said councillor Angela Cortese. She said she was equally angered by a local priest, Don Paolo Cecere, who praised the move and claimed it could cut down on sexual harassment. &quot;This turns the clock back years for women and undermines all our victories,&quot; she said.</p><p>The Italian consumer group Aduc added: &quot;Is Castellammare di Stabia in the province of Naples? No, it's in the province of Teheran.&quot;</p><p>The miniskirt ban is one of 41 new decorum measures introduced by Bobbio. Swearing in public, kicking footballs in the street, lying on benches, climbing trees and walking a dog with a lead longer than two metres will also be targeted. Bobbio said people would not be allowed to wander off the beach in their swimming costume. &quot;This is not Mallorca,&quot; he said.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.guardian.co.uk)</i></p>",

The novelist’s striking phrase helped to set the scene (16) amid the turmoil of the French Revolution – but the paper on which he wrote <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> might not endure for much longer (17).</p><p>This weekend the Victoria and Albert Museum is launching a campaign to raise funds to conserve the original manuscripts of three of Dickens’s novels, including <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. Rescued from the novelist’s home (18), the manuscripts came to the V&A in 1876 when Forster, a literary agent, bequeathed his library to the fledgling museum. The V&A now hopes to restore the priceless originals – which are still legible although blotched – (19) of the bicentenary of Dickens’s birth in 2012.</p><p>Written on low-grade blue writing paper, the manuscripts were never “wonderful quality”, (20), deputy keeper of word and image at the V&A.

        "text": "<p>Robyn Scott was nearly seven when, in 1987, her parents upped sticks with her younger brother and sister, leaving the gentle green of New Zealand to return to the place they were raised – Selebi, 150km from the borders of South Africa and Zimbabwe on the eastern edge of Botswana. It was a move that would lead to 13 eccentric, broadly idyllic years that Scott describes in her book.</p><p>The Scotts converted a shaky cowshed next to the property of Robyn’s paternal grandfather, improvising a new floor with varnished brown paper and trying to sidestep the snakes in the laundry.</p><p>Robyn’s father, Keith, devoted his working day to remote bush clinics, where he might see 100 patients in a day, returning by car or plane red-eyed, exhausted and full of curious tales. Her mother, Linda, insisted on home schooling and wholewheat bread, and filled their days with an array of adventures and botanical expeditions.</p><p>The three children sucked it up – growing sensible, upright and untroubled by convention, continuously engaged and endlessly thrilled. Robyn’s first youthful commercial exercise was to rescue 20 battery chickens from destruction, producing a free-range egg business whose profits went part-way towards a new saddle for her wild pony. Both she and her sister chose to be vegetarians. They nurtured a vivarium of snakes and cared for just about any animal that presented itself, endlessly rescuing flailing insects from their back-yard pool.</p><p>But Keith dreamed of owning a freehold farm in Botswana and returning it to its original beauty, so the family moved on from Selebi after five years to a 2,000-acre farm in south-eastern Botswana. This was an intensely green, watery wonderland, with crocodiles, hippos and antelope, and teamed with bird life.</p><p>Molope Farm was thrilling – a “ferocious but fragile” paradise. Tighter schedules, tests and homework came as the children moved on to secondary schools across the borders in Zimbabwe and South Africa. And as the children became increasingly independent, their parents were ever more caught up with their own campaigns – Keith with Aids awareness and alternative therapies; Linda with her nutritional studies and books.</p><p><i>Twenty Chickens for a Saddle</i> is such a bravura performance that it is difficult to believe it is Robyn Scott’s first book. It is a confident portrait of a rollicking family that championed laughter and independence of thought and action at every turn.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(telegraph.co.uk)</i></p>",

        "text": "<p>One of the biggest problems facing the world in 2013 is the prolonged – and seemingly intractable – crisis of youth unemployment. Put simply, too many young people lack employable skills in a world that has too few skilled workers. The result is that in parts of the Middle East and North Africa youth unemployment remains stuck at around 25%; in Spain and South Africa about half of young would-be-workers are unemployed; globally around 75m people aged 15 to 24 are jobless, and the International Labour Organisation expects this dismaying unemployment rate of almost 13% to rise.</p><p>Clearly, this is a critical business issue. In a recent survey of more than 4,555 young people, 2,700 employers and 900 education providers across America, Brazil, Britain, Germany, India and Turkey, some 40% of employers reported that they struggle to fill entry-level jobs because the candidates have inadequate skills. Almost 45% of young people said that their current jobs were not related to their studies, and of these more than half view the jobs as interim and are looking to leave. Without a remedy for this mismatch of demand and supply, we forecast that by 2020 there will be a global shortfall of 85m high- and middle-skill workers for the labour market.</p><p>So what should be done? The heart of the matter is helping the young learn relevant skills more effectively, and that requires greater co-operation – and communication – between companies, governments and education providers. Among several promising approaches, one favoured by students is the “practicum”: a practical course involving either hands-on learning in the classroom or training on the job. Sadly, less than a quarter of education-providers use such methods – yet they should be the 21st-century equivalent of the 20th-century apprenticeship, a way for people to learn and continuously update their skills. If such training is underpinned by a certification system, employees (and employers) will know that skills are transferable across companies and industries.</p><p>Such remedies are both necessary and available to solve a talent gap that will be the biggest business challenge of the coming decade. It makes no sense that in the coming years college graduates will still be taking menial, part-time jobs because they have inadequate skills for their chosen career.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The Economist&#41;</i></p>",

Michelangelo is a frustrated factory worker; Plato spends his time herding oxen.</p><p>As it turned out, that footage was just a small excerpt from a film that was finally completed in 2011, (16) that begins at the dawn of creation, ends with man’s last gasp and includes stopovers in ancient Greece, 17th-century Prague, Dickensian London and outer space, among others. At 160 minutes – about three hours, including the intermissions – the film includes one visual spectacle after the next. Each of the 15 sections is animated (17), with look-alikes of Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mickey Mouse and the Beatles.</p><p>The film is an adaptation of the poet Imre Madach’s play (18), which is considered one of the great works of Hungarian literature. The action takes place over the course of one very long dream, as Adam, Eve and a chatty Lucifer visit the world’s great civilizations at the height of their power, (19) as humanity’s noblest hopes and dreams come to naught.</p><p>Marcell Jankovics is Hungary’s best-known living animator. In 1976 his film “Sisyphus,” (20) about the doomed, boulder-pushing king was among the nominees for an Academy Award; the next year his “Kuzdok” (The Struggle) won the Palme D’Or for short film in Cannes. By the time Mr. Jankovics first started working on “Tragedy” in 1983, he had already directed (21) “Janos Vitez,” Hungary’s first animated feature.</p><p>“I knew pretty well that I needed three years to make one movie,” Mr. Jankovics said. “Since this is (22), it counts as two, so that’s six years. So I basically spent six years making the movie.”</p><p>And the other two decades or so? “The rest of the time,” he said, “was spent raising funds.” The last bit of money (23) came in 2008, when Mr. Jankovics allowed General Motors to use “Sisyphus” in an ad for the GMC Yukon Hybrid.

The slight trick in the question is that, by asking you what you were hearing, I prompted your brain to take control of the sensory experience – and made you listen rather than just hear. The difference between the sense of hearing and the skill of listening is attention.</p><p>There are different types of attention, and they use different parts of the brain. A sudden loud noise that makes you jump activates the simplest type that converts the noise into a defensive response in a mere tenth of a second. More complex attention is controlled by pathways mostly in the right hemisphere – areas that process the raw, sensory input.</p><p>But when you actually pay attention to something you’re listening to, a separate pathway comes into play. Here, the signals are conveyed through a pathway in a part of the brain that does more computation, which lets you actively focus on what you’re hearing and tune out everything that isn’t immediately important.</p><p>Hearing, in short, is easy. But listening, really listening, is hard. It is a skill that we’re in danger of losing in a world of digital distraction and information overload. And yet we dare not lose it. Because listening tunes our brain to patterns of our environment faster than any other sense, and paying attention to the non-visual parts of our world feeds into everything from our intellectual sharpness to our dance skills.</p><p>Luckily, we can train our listening, just as with any other skill. Listen to new music when jogging rather than familiar tunes. Listen to your dog’s whines and barks: he’s trying to tell you something isn’t right. Listen to your partner’s voice – not only to the words, but to the sounds under them, the emotions carried in the harmonics. You may save yourself a couple of fights.</p><p>“You never listen” is not just the complaint of a problematic relationship, it has also become an epidemic in a world that is exchanging convenience for content, speed for meaning. The richness of life doesn’t lie in the loudness and the beat, but in the timbres and the variations that you can discern if you simply pay attention.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The New York Times&#41;</i></p><p><h3>SUMMARY</h3></p><p>Hearing is an automatic whereas (0) is a conscious process. The key word to describe how the two differ is (24). The brain processes a noise that might signify (25) in a fraction of a second. Different types of sound (26) different pathways in the brain.

Morris.</p><p>The Capa photograph of a Gypsy wedding in Slovakia in 1947 could be the rarest surviving image by the Magnum agency photographer, who was killed covering the conflict in Indochina in 1954. The photo survives only as a single print, with the negative thought to have been lost in the 1950s, and is expected to fetch up to £9,000 in Paris on 20 April.</p><p>The collection of photographs from the 1930s to the 1970s was amassed over 70 years by the veteran magazine photo editor John G. Morris, a colleague and close friend of many of the 20th century’s greatest newspaper and magazine photographers. Morris, now aged 94, was the London picture editor of <i>Life</i> magazine during the Second World War. At its peak, <i>Life</i> regularly sold millions of copies a week.</p><p>Capa had already been hailed as the world’s greatest war photographer for his Spanish civil war images, including the famous “falling soldier” shot, when Morris worked with him on the story that led to the most famous series of photographs of all time – the surviving “magnificent 11” shots of US troops landing on Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day.</p><p>Also included in the auction, entitled The Photo Diary of John G. Morris, are hitherto unseen photographs taken by Morris in France soon after D-Day, while he was working with his staff photographers on the frontline. Of great interest to photo-historians is a rare shot of Capa at work, photographing German prisoners being rounded up in Normandy. No other shot of Capa at work in a war zone is known to exist.</p><p>“As far as I know, this is the first photojournalism collection to come on to the art market,” said Morris. “My personal favourite is the Capa shot of the Gypsies. That picture seems to touch people.

From Professor McGonagall’s love for a Muggle (a non-wizard) as a young woman, to how the Dursleys (Harry’s horrible uncle and aunt) met; from new information about Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, three of the four houses at Hogwarts, to details about magic wands, Rowling’s writing will be just one part of the richly interactive, free Pottermore.com website. Pottermore.com is intended to bring the Harry Potter storylines to interactive life for readers. “Just as I have contributed to the website, everyone else will be able to join in by submitting their own comments, drawings and other content in a safe and friendly environment,” Rowling said.</p><p>Starting with the first novel in the series, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>, Pottermore will allow its users to navigate their way through the story with interactive ‘moments’. Users start out by choosing a magical username, and as they move through the chapters of the book they will be sorted into houses – Rowling herself has written a ‘vast pool’ of questions to direct users to their correct home – and experience life at the school, just like Harry. Points can be won for houses by casting spells and mixing potions – and Rowling herself will be dropping in ‘as an ordinary visitor’ now and then.</p><p>“If you are not sorted into Harry’s house, Gryffindor, if you go into one of the other three houses, you will effectively get an extra quarter of a chapter. You will go off into your own common room, meet your own prefect, and find out what the true nature of the house is. In the main novel you only see the houses through the eyes of the heroes. So it’s not a terrible thing to be in Slytherin,” said the author.</p><p>For the moment, Pottermore will be restricted to the first book, but all seven books will be added in due course with new material from Rowling – including, she promised, a more detailed explanation of Quidditch, the wizarding sport played at Hogwarts.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.guardian.co.uk)</i></p>",

So far, the age range is from high school to retirees, and the course has attracted interest from more than 175 countries.</p><p>The instructors are Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig, two of the world’s best-known artificial intelligence experts. In 2005 Dr. Thrun led a team of Stanford students and professors in building a robotic car that won a Pentagon-sponsored competition by driving 132 miles over unpaved roads in a California desert. More recently, he has led a secret Google project to develop autonomous vehicles that have driven more than 100,000 miles on public roads in California. Dr. Norvig is a former NASA scientist who is now Google’s director of research and the author of a textbook on artificial intelligence.</p><p>The two scientists said they had been inspired by the recent work of Salman Khan, an M.I.T.–educated electrical engineer, who in 2006 established a nonprofit organization to provide video tutorials to students around the world on a variety of subjects via YouTube. His vision is to change the world by bringing education to places that can’t be reached today. The Khan Academy focuses on high school and middle school.</p><p>How will the artificial intelligence instructors assess 58,000 students? The scientists said they would make extensive use of technology. In place of office hours, they will use the Google moderator service, software that will allow students to vote on the best questions for the professors to respond to in an online chat. They are considering personalizing the exams to minimize cheating. Part of the instructional software was developed by Know Labs, a company Dr. Thrun helped start.</p><p>( <i>The New York Times)</i></p>",

Prospective employers are increasingly using ‘extreme interviewing’ techniques which include questions such as: ‘If you were a dinosaur, what would you be?’</p><p>Although they say the way the candidate handles the question is more important than the actual answer, chances are that if you said you were a Tyrannosaurus rex, you won’t be getting the job. Apparently, the hapless candidate is told: ‘Aha, so you are a cannibalistic predator preying on the weak, are you?’</p><p>The dinosaur tactic, a favourite of City employers, is part of a craze for throwing bizarre questions at candidates to see how they react. Some other genuine questions asked of potential employees include: ‘If you were a biscuit, what sort would you be?’ ‘Name me three Lady Gaga songs.’ And ‘With a four-minute hourglass, and a seven-minute hourglass, how can you measure exactly nine minutes – without taking longer than nine minutes?’</p><p>The technique – designed to distinguish the capable candidate from the exceptional at a time when a quarter of recent graduates are unemployed – originated in California’s Silicon Valley. Google, which is based there, is renowned for its intense interview process, with 50-page dossiers sometimes being prepared for a potential employee. One recent question was: ‘You are stranded on a desert island. You have 60 seconds to choose people of ten professions to come with you. Who do you choose? Go!’</p><p>Computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard prefers questions such as: ‘If Germans were the tallest people in the world, how would you prove it?’ – a reference to the first line of their national anthem, Deutschland Deutschland über alles.</p><p>The idea of extreme interviewing is to see how quickly job-seekers think on their feet and one of its pioneers was the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. Dealing with a candidate he considered dull, Jobs started flapping his arms and clucking like a chicken to judge his reaction.</p><p>David Moyle, a headhunter with the Eximius Group in London, admits he has used the dinosaur question to recruit.

A man who was referred to Thames Reach by St Thomas’s hospital had been trafficked into the country by a gang. When he complained about not being paid, he was beaten up and left on the streets with brain damage. Other cases involved two Hungarian men who were held by criminals in Birmingham and forced to work on driveways, and a Czech man who was beaten by the owners of a car wash in north London before escaping.</p><p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has worked with the Passage Centre to fund a campaign to highlight the issue, and embassies in eastern Europe are also helping to raise awareness of the risk involved in working in the UK.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The Observer&#41;</i></p>",

        "example": "true",
        "text": "<p>In his landmark new book, the Harvard professor argues we are much less violent than our ancestors.</p><p>Steven Pinker has dedicated much of his academic life to the study of human nature and, perhaps surprisingly, his latest book is full of good news. In <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature: The Decline of Violence in History and Its Causes</i>, the celebrated evolutionary psychologist and bestselling author argues that we – the human race – are becoming progressively less violent. To the consumer of 24-hour news, steeped in images of conflict and war, that may sound plain wrong. But Pinker supports his case with a wealth of data.</p><p>Drawing on the work of a fellow Harvard archaeologist, Pinker recently concluded that the chances of our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors meeting a bloody end were somewhere between 15% and 60%. In the 20th century, which included two world wars and the mass killers Stalin and Hitler, the likelihood of a European or American dying a violent death was less than 1%.</p><p>Pinker shows that, with notable exceptions, the long-term trend for murder and violence has been going down since humans first developed agriculture 10,000 years ago. And it has dropped steeply since the Middle Ages. Oxford in the 1300s, Pinker tells us, was 110 times more murderous than it is today. He calls this movement away from killing the “civilising process”.</p><p>Nowadays, the notion that life is measurably improving is about as unfashionable as the conviction that western culture is in any sense civilising. Pinker is likely to stand accused of Panglossian* naivety. Indeed, he says that when he told colleagues what he was writing, they said he reminded them of the man who jumped off the top of a tall building and halfway down observed: “It looks good so far.”</p><p>In an earlier book Pinker wrote: “The strongest argument against totalitarianism may be a recognition of a universal human nature; that all humans have innate desires for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It’s this vision of our common humanity, what Abraham Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature”, that animates Pinker’s latest book.</p><p style='font-size:small'>* Pangloss: Candide’s tutor in Voltaire’s satire <i>Candide or The Optimist</i></p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.guardian.co.uk)</i></p>",

Fitting into a tool kit bag, his library consists of 35 energy-efficient light bulbs – both fluorescent and LED –, which he lends to the citizens of Ashtead, Surrey. The bulbs come in all shapes, sizes and strengths.</p><p>The library, which started up this summer, lends the light bulbs for a week at a time and allows Ashtead residents to experiment for free to find out which light bulbs suit their homes and fittings best, before investing in them wholesale.</p><p>“Energy-efficient light bulbs, particularly the LED ones, are still very expensive compared to tungsten ones and people are reluctant to spend £10 to £15 a bulb if they think it will make their home either too dim or too harshly lit,” says Barrie, a member of the group Transition Ashtead, which aims to help members reduce their energy consumption.</p><p>“This lets people experiment before they buy. Response has been good, with borrowers telling me the light-up speed and colour quality are much better than they feared and, as a result, they will go ahead and replace their tungsten bulbs.”</p><p>Simon Kenton, of Oxfordshire Community Action Groups, which oversees the county’s 25 community groups, says very often groups of local people are quick to catch on to what is useful, in terms of reducing energy and waste, but are unable or unwilling to spend large amounts of money on eco gadgets.</p><p>“Other groups lend out items like can crushers, newspaper log-makers and home energy meters as well as light bulbs. In many cases, such as energy meters, people don’t need these things forever – just using them for a week will let people know where they are wasting energy and they can cost up to £100 to buy in the shops,” he says.</p><p>“We are at the moment investing in a thermal imaging camera to add to the libraries so people can see at a glance where the heat is escaping from their home. Again, a thermal camera can cost upwards of £3,000 and you only use it once or twice.

It was something worth doing for their country.</p><p>The generosity was often prompted by sadness. (26). So did war. The bachelor Robert Ketton-Cremer made over his Norfolk house after his brother died of wounds on a Cretan airfield in the Second World War. Waterson says that his conversations with many donors “suggested that their military service shaped their thinking about other forms of service”.

At 7am on January 30th, 1889, the Archduke Rudolf, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was found dead together with his mistress, Baroness Marie Vetsera in the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods, fifteen miles southwest of the capital. Was it suicide as (0) or was it murder? The police closed their investigations with surprising haste, and the dossier on the investigations (22) in the state archives as it should normally have been. Members of the Imperial household were sworn to secrecy. Yet, despite these attempts to cover up, almost at once (23) in Vienna of a politically motivated assassination.</p><p>The death of the Crown Prince had grave consequences for the history of Europe. Undoubtedly, it (24) in the developments that led to the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist at Sarajevo in June 1914 and the subsequent drift into the First World War.</p><p>Unlike his conservative father, the Emperor Franz Joseph, Rudolf was reform-minded and liberal. His education (25) by one of his tutors, Father Jacint Rónay, who taught the young Rudolf about philosophy, the ethics of power and the history of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Rónay (26) in the Hungarian Democratic Revolution of 1848 to 1849; he had narrowly escaped capture and lived in England as an exile for almost two decades. With his writings and lectures during this period, he (27) as a radical philosopher.</p><p>Rónay was much impressed by the maturity of the young Rudolf and, as well as shaping his thinking in a liberal mould, instilled in him a deep sense of his historical responsibility. Using various pen names, Rudolf began to write newspaper articles and pamphlets (28) pan-German Austrian policies and spelling out his own radical ideas about internal reforms and foreign policies. By the end of 1888, Rudolf (29) the German Kaiser Wilhelm and the Emperor Franz Joseph, as well as powerful pan-German members of the Vienna establishment.</p><p>So were the rumours true? If so, who exactly were the paymasters who hired the hit-men for that January night in 1889? We may never know. What we do know is that Rudolf (30): Wilhelm did try to create a Greater German Reich by force of arms and, in the process, totally destabilized the whole of Europe for the next half century.</p>",

From the advice: “Lose ugly weight fast!!/ Feel Happier! Healthier!/ Dump your bigotry” to: “Meet local singles!!/ Easy: stand near others/ Hang up your cell phone” and: “Free debt counselling/ Take the important first step/ Beware signs like these”, the artist has written 10 different haikus, printed 50 copies of each and placed them at 500 locations across Atlanta.</p><p>“People read these bandit signs. They’ll read them if it’s about an electrician or they’ll read them if it’s about anything”, explained Morse. “So if they read it and they like it, great, if they read it and they don’t like it, great. But the fact is they’ll read it, they’re going to read my poetry and that’s my goal.</p><p>“There’s a great deal of bad in the world, and one of the few things that helps endure the cruelties of the world is art,” he said. “A little bit of art can do a great deal of good. And I want to spend my life doing something good … Will it be good? I don’t know. But I’m going to try.”</p><p>Backed by artist support group Flux Projects, which says the signs offer “compact observations and commentary on modern life”, the Roadside Haiku initiative is scheduled to run until the end of October. The haikus haven’t been welcomed by everyone, however: Peggy Denby of Keep Atlanta Beautiful described them as “litter on a stick” and told local news site wsbtv.com there would be fines if they weren’t taken down.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(http:/www.guardian.co.uk)</i></p><p style='font-size:small'>*haiku: short poem</p>",

Hailed as the brainiest woman on British television, the postgraduate classics student became a cult figure last week, with commentators divided over whether she was to be praised for her brilliance or denounced as “horribly smug”.</p><p>Laughing excitedly, Trimble, 26, repeatedly slammed her buzzer to address questions ranging from literature to science. Possibly the contest’s most successful ever contestant, she scored more right answers than any other participant – getting right over two thirds of all the questions. (“Which of Shakespeare’s plays is the only one to be set in Vienna and concerns the city’s Duke adopting a disguise?” “Measure for Measure.” “Which German bacteriologist gave his name to a shallow glass or plastic cylindrical dish that biologists use to culture cells?” “Petri.” “The name of the kingdom that according to Aristophanes was built by birds?” “Cloud Cuckoo Land.” etc.)</p><p>Tiny Corpus Christi College triumphed over Manchester University but it was the beating the team gave to Exeter University in the quarter final – described by the stunned question master as “less a quiz, more a cull” – that first brought the Trimble phenomenon to public attention.</p><p>Not all reaction has been pleasant, though. There have been some nasty comments, and she has been ridiculed on social networking sites for being too intellectual. Miss Trimble – bespectacled with long brown hair and a beaming smile – said she had been taken aback by the hostility after experiencing no such problems at school or university. Asked if she thought there was an element of sexism in it she said: “I’m sure this wouldn’t happen if I wasn’t a woman.”</p><p>Trimble, whose mother was a magistrate and father a BT manager, gained four A-levels at A grade and was always a brainbox. “I seemed to find school a lot easier than other people – I realised I was a bit different because my classmates were always asking for help with their homework.”</p><p>But there’s a lighter side too. She likes cooking, gin and tonic and The Simpsons* – and has a boyfriend of five years, Tom West, a trainee solicitor. Nonetheless, it’s not always easy having a massive brain. “I’ve had lots of issues about my self image – I try really hard not to come across as too clever.”</p><p style='font-size:small'>* The Simpsons: humorous television cartoon programme</p><p><i>&#40;The Sunday Times 01.03.2009&#41;</i></p>",

        "text": "<p>When it comes to top level domain names, some countries are luckier than others. Take the Pacific Ocean island of Tuvalu, for instance, which offers the attractive <i>.tv</i> for the broadcast media. Or Tonga, whose <i>.to</i> domain has given birth to sites such as <i>go.to</i> and <i>how.to</i>. Perhaps most fortunate of all in the name game is Montenegro.</p><p>After separating from Serbia in 2006, the country gained <i>.me</i> – the perfect domain for the social media generation. &quot;From the beginning it was clear that <i>.me</i> would have its share in the market,&quot; said Predrag Lesic, executive director of the <i>.me</i> registry in Montenegro.</p><p>That share is now huge. Since <i>.me</i> went live in 2008, more than 320,000 names have been registered, making it the fastest selling debut top level domain ever. It is short, personal and popular - with names like <i>youand.me</i> and <i>whatabout.me</i>. It is being used more than anything else as a call-to-action domain, for example <i>notify.me</i>. The domain's popularity is partly down to its versatility across different languages.</p><p>Even before the domain's launch, Montenegro's registrars were flooded with requests for names. &quot;There have been three development phases,&quot; said Mr Lesic. &quot;In the first period we were receiving applications for the trademark names only. International companies like Microsoft and Samsung rushed to register their <i>.me</i> name. The second phase allowed local people to register an interest in a domain, while the third, go-live phase – which started on 17 July 2008 - opened up the registry to customers worldwide. On the first day of the go-live period, we had 50,000 registrations.&quot;</p><p>One buyer of the <i>.me</i> domain was Matt Mansell, who purchased <i>willshemarry.me</i>. As it turns out she did marry him – and the site was used as a way of informing guests how to get to the wedding. But, aside from his new wife, the domain name may prove to be Mr Mansell's greatest gain from his wedding. &quot;I've had an awful lot of people who want to buy the idea; I've had people who want to buy the domain. A lot of the <i>.me</i> names are actually selling at online auctions for figures like $10,000-$15,000.&quot;</p><p>Although it is a very lucrative market, technology commentator Bill Thompson is not convinced with the value attached to a memorable domain name. &quot;I'm a domain name cynic. More and more people just go to their favourite search engine, type in what they're looking for and don't actually look for where it's going. So I just don't think domain names are as important as they were. And I don't think they should be.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(http://news.bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

When a customer chose a length, it was said to have “been spoken for”. A tailor who makes a customer’s clothes individually is called “bespoke”.

        "example": "true",
        "text": "<p>A hijack-proof piloting system for airliners is being developed to prevent terrorists repeating the 9/11 outrages. The mechanism is designed to make it impossible to crash the aircraft into air or land targets - and enable the plane to be flown by remote control from the ground in the event of an emergency. Scientists at aircraft giant Boeing are testing the autopilot system which uses state-of-the-art computer and satellite technology. It will be activated by the pilot flicking a simple switch or by pressure sensors in the cockpit door that will respond to any excessive force as terrorists try to break into the flight deck. After it has been turned on, no one on board will be able to deactivate the system. Currently, all autopilots are manually switched on and off by the pilots.</p><p>The system will connect ground controllers and security services with the aircraft using radio waves. After it has been activated, the aircraft will be capable of remote digital control from the ground, enabling operators to fly it like a model plane, manoeuvring it vertically and laterally.</p><p>A threatened airliner could be flown to a secure airport, where it would touch down using existing landing aids known as 'autoland function'. After it had landed, the aircraft's built-in autobrake would bring the plane safely to a halt on the runway.</p><p>Boeing insiders say the new anti-hijack kit could be fitted to airliners all over the world within the next three years. The latest move to fight airline terrorists follows The Mail on Sunday's disclosure three weeks ago that scientists in Britain and Germany are developing a passenger-monitoring device. This will use tiny cameras linked to computers to record every facial expression or suspicious movement made on board flights in order to identify potential terrorists.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman said: &quot;We are constantly studying ways we can improve the safety, security and efficiency of the world's airline fleet. There is a need in the industry for a technique that conclusively prevents unauthorised persons gaining access to the controls and threatening the safety of passengers. Once this system is initiated, no one on board is capable of controlling the flight, making it useless for anyone to threaten violence in order to gain control.&quot;</p>",

He claims he’s forever ducking in and out of the aisles, like a soldier in a war zone, seeking cover where he can find it. (10).</p><p>And as he says, ‘You particularly don’t want to meet that former teacher, because either they’ll struggle to remember you, which is embarrassing, or they will remember you, which is again embarrassing, or they’ll ask you how things are going now, which is embarrassing in a new way. (11).’</p><p>I hadn’t fully appreciated the angst created by ex-teachers in supermarkets. It’s hardly their fault, of course. They imagine they’re just nipping in to grab a cheesecake or some grapes.

So when I meet somebody, I’d be wondering: have I buried their mum? Baptised their daughter? Or heard their confession of adultery? This can make for a tricky opening few seconds of conversation. (13).</p><p>There are those worse off than Bob, however. After all, if he walks into the store and discovers the person he least wants to meet in the world – well, he can always walk out.

        "text": "<p>Jasper Rees meets the director who is introducing Shakespeare to Fawlty Towers*</p><p>Exactly how funny is <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> in the 21st century? With Christopher Luscombe as director, this month’s new production at Shakespeare’s Globe is likely to be very funny indeed. Two summers ago Luscombe had a popular hit at the same theatre with a Comedy of Errors production inspired by the <i>Carry On</i> films. For this fresh attempt to make the more difficult parts of Shakespearean comedy accessible to a modern audience, his reference point is sitcom.</p><p>“<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> feels very conversational, very relaxed,” he says. “It seems to me to be written absolutely as people spoke. But I was scared of using the sitcom tag until I read this very authoritative academic article comparing <i>Merry Wives</i> with <i>Fawlty Towers</i>. There are so many connections. John Cleese* must have been familiar with it.”</p><p>It is often claimed that <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> came about as a result of a royal request. The queen, having enjoyed Falstaff’s visits to the Boar’s Head tavern in <i>Henry IV part one</i>, wanted to be further entertained by the fat knight, and Shakespeare dutifully bashed out his only play set in contemporary England.</p><p>The first question for Luscombe to answer was which version of the play to stage. A Quarto edition was cobbled together by actors in 1604, the more reliable Folio published in 1623. The traditional approach is to work from the Folio, but Luscombe has chosen to marry the two. “There is no version that Shakespeare saw through to publication. You have to do what you feel he would approve of. I feel he’d say ‘whatever works’, particularly in a play like this. It’s no great poetry. All I’m trying to do is make 400-year-old material really funny.”</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;Daily Telegraph Review&#41;</i></p><p style='font-size:small'>*Fawlty Towers: a humorous TV series</p><p style='font-size:small'>*John Cleese: the actor playing Mr Fawlty</p>",

Reading these books you occasionally note a tone of slight impatience from the author when the really tricky stuff comes along. “Look, you dummies, it just <i>is</i>, ok?”</p><p>Or, as Christopher Potter repeatedly puts it in this elegant and thoughtfully constructed contribution to the genre: “Shut up and calculate!” Even Feynman, a brilliant Nobel prize- winning scientist, who tried to get the message across a generation ago in <i>Six Easy Pieces</i>, struggled; not all of those pieces are <i>that</i> easy, to be honest.</p><p>Potter’s book works because he is not (quite) a physicist, but nor is he merely a layman. He is a publisher with a fairly modest (he suggests) academic background in mathematics and the history of science. And this is the root of the book’s brilliance: Potter becomes a link between the bizarre world of the quantum physicists and our own rather more limited imaginations.</p><p>He makes complicated numbers comprehensible by taking us from the world we know and recognise – everything around us for ten metres, for example, from the size of a giraffe to the size of a human being – in stages down to things so small that size has no real meaning, and upwards to distances that, without his guidance, would seem so great as to be meaningless. The distances and the scale become comprehensible.</p><p>Potter takes us beyond the realms of the solar system, past our nearest neighbouring star (four light years away), beyond the outer boundaries of our galaxy, the Milky Way, until, near the end, we hit a solid supercluster of galaxies one billion light years away. And then, a little later, we are dragged through ever-diminishing stages back down to the quarks, which are at the very boundary of what we might call both “size” and “reality”.</p><p>This is the most thoughtful pop science book of the last few years, and, along with <i>The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing</i>, the most useful to the layman.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>&#40;The Sunday Times&#41;</i></p>",

It only takes a couple of hours to scoot away and explore everything from snowy Arctic wastes to balmy Mediterranean paradises. Here are some must-sees...</p><p>The Southern Dalmatian islands of Croatia are some of the most untouched parts of the Mediterranean. Until recently, many of them were closed by the military. But this doesn’t mean they lack charm. You can walk the cobbled streets of the fortified town of Korcula, (alleged birthplace of Marco Polo), eat fresh fish in the hidden harbour of Lastovo or visit the Blue Cave − so called because of the effect of sunlight shining through an underwater entrance.</p><p>The best way to see the islands is by boat. Sail Croatia offers good prices on skippered yachts. At night you can moor in a quiet spot and eat on board or drop anchor closer to shore and hang out in a restaurant. During the day, explore the islands or sail to a deserted cove to swim in bright turquoise water.</p><p>The Svalbard Archipelago, comprising over a thousand islands, almost all of them uninhabited, is officially part of Norway but is well within the Arctic Circle. In the winter, the sun never shines but in the short summer there is permanent daylight. The archipelago is home to the fierce polar bear. They wander freely across the pack ice, hunting for seals. If you walk outside the tiny settlement of Longyearbyen on the island of Spitsbergen, you are advised to have an armed guard to keep you safe.</p><p>The remote east of Svalbard is stunningly beautiful, with mountains, glaciers and kilometres of floating pack ice. The Explorer, owned by Gap Adventures, cruises these waters looking out for polar bears, walruses and reindeer.</p><p>Closer to home, don’t miss the Isles of Scilly. Just off the coast of Cornwall, each of these islands has its own character. Bryher is sometimes hit by gale force winds that sweep in from the Atlantic, but the islands generally enjoy a balmy sub-tropical climate. On Tresco you can walk through forests of giant tree ferns from New Zealand and appreciate cacti from all over the world. There are kilometres of unspoilt beaches, as well as the highest concentration of archaeological sites in the country. There are burial chambers, menhirs (standing stones) and the remains of Stone Age villages.</p>",

It’s all been democratised, and anyone can do it. Right?</p><p>Well, that’s what some of us at the Daily Telegraph arts desk were hoping when we came up with the idea of trying to get into the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.</p><p>It’s the granddady of all open access shows, the country’s greatest opportunity − no, the world’s greatest opportunity − for painters to get their works on the walls of a prestigious gallery.</p><p>We knew the odds were stacked against us − there were, after all, almost 9,000 entries this year, and only 1,000 of them were successful.

Even allowing for compulsory politeness to friends and colleagues, what we had produced didn’t seem too bad at all. Some had revealed unsuspected skill, others great imagination and others, well, a certain low cunning.</p><p>Did any of us get in? No. But we’d taken part in a remarkable British institution, we’d felt a sense of fellowship with the extraordinary community of have-a-go artists, and we had reawakened faculties which in some of us had lain dormant since childhood.</p><p>And we consoled ourselves with the thought cherished by rejected artists through the ages − the world isn’t ready for us yet.</p>",

        "text": "<p>One recent day at the Brooklyn Free School, the ''schedule'' included the following: horror movies, chess and making caves for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Not that the students had to go to any of these sessions. At this school, students don't get grades, don't have homework, don't take tests, and don't even have to go to class unless they want to.</p><p>''You can do basically anything at any time, and it's just a lot more fun because sometimes when you need a break at regular schools you can't get it,'' said Sophia Bennett Holmes, 12, an aspiring singer-actress-fashion designer.</p><p>''Free schools,'' which had their flowering decades ago, operate on the belief that children are naturally curious and learn best when they want to, not when they are forced to. Today, the approach is getting another look from some parents and students tired of standardized testing, excessive homework, and overly rigid curriculums in traditional education.</p><p>At the Brooklyn Free School, much of the decision-making occurs in a compulsory weekly gathering. Here, students can air grievances, pose challenges and propose rules. Even the youngest kids have a vote equal to staffers. One agreed-upon rule? No sword-fighting allowed inside.</p><p>Even among some champions of alternative education, free schools are considered a bit too radical. ''You don't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' said Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform. ''You don't get rid of all structure and standards if you want your child to be able to deal with all different settings.'' Others say free schools could gain popularity if the emphasis on testing and regimented curriculums keeps up in traditional schools.</p><p>But what about the basics? Long division, spelling, algebra? Is it enough to let a child decide when to learn those things? That troubles a few parents who use outside tutors for their children. Others disagree, noting most adults can barely remember, or rarely use, most of what schools pounded into them.</p><p>Students at this school will eventually have to meet a set of graduation ''requirements,'' where they must present a portfolio showing proficiency in areas such as communication, investigation and reflection.</p><p>But the definition of proficiency, like much of the school, is flexible.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Conflict diamonds, also known as blood diamonds, are diamonds that are used by rebel groups to fuel conflict and civil wars. They have financed brutal conflicts in Africa that have resulted in the death and displacement of millions of people. Diamonds have also been used by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda to fund their activities and for money-laundering purposes.</p><p>Before the premier of the movie <i>Blood Diamond</i>, leading human rights organizations Global Witness and Amnesty International, along with other experts, warned that blood diamonds are still a problem and called on the public to urge governments, especially the U.S. government, and the diamond industry to strengthen diamond-monitoring systems. They also ask consumers to demand written guarantees from retailers that their jewellery contains no conflict diamonds. “Right now there is no way of ensuring 100 percent that the diamond in your engagement ring is conflict free,” said C. Gooch, Executive Director of Global Witness. “But consumers can change this, by taking a firm stand.”</p><p>Dramatic undercover footage, released before the film’s premier by a UK company in association with Insight News TV, showed New York diamond dealers eager and willing to buy diamonds with no accompanying paperwork to confirm that they are not blood diamonds. The film <i>Blood Diamond</i> is set against the backdrop of civil war and chaos in 1990’s</p><p>Sierra Leone, and is the story of Archer, a South African mercenary, and Solomon, a Mende fisherman. Both men are African, but their histories are as different as can be, until their fates become joined in a common search to recover a rare pink diamond that can transform their lives. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon – who was taken from his family to work in the diamond fields – has found and hidden the extraordinary rough stone. With the help of Maddy, an American journalist, the two men set off on a journey through rebel territory, a journey that could save Solomon’s family and give Archer a chance he thought he would never have.</p><p>“A film can be an incredibly powerful means of inspiring people to take action,” said Amy O’Meara of Amnesty International. “What <i>Blood Diamond</i> illustrates is that even a small percentage of conflict stones can have tragic consequences.”</p><p>Global Witness and Amnesty International work to highlight the links between the exploitation of natural resources, conflict and corruption. Global Witness was co-nominated for the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize for its work in campaigning against conflict diamonds and for setting up an international diamond certification scheme.</p>",

He also lost his job after sending up to 500 emails a day from his office computer, many to his former girlfriend. The couple separated because she could no longer cope with the barrage of digital communication.</p><p>&quot;He was suffering from severe anxiety when he wasn't getting any reply, which was causing him to text and email even more,&quot; said Phillip Irvine, project leader of Renfrew Council on Alcohol trust, where the unnamed man is being treated. &quot;This patient has all the hallmarks of any classic addict where mental health problems such as depression, low self- esteem and relationship difficulties occur as a result of the addiction.&quot;</p><p>The teenager described the buzz he got from his texting saying: &quot;When you look at your mobile and you've got a message you wonder who it could be. It's kind of comforting when you get one.&quot; Mr Irvine said the teenager was trying to cut his mobile phone spending down to £10 a week from £60.</p><p>&quot;This addiction problem is probably suffered by many more people but it is not being diagnosed,&quot; he said. &quot;Young people and those with an extroverted personality are particularly susceptible.&quot;</p><p>David Nott, the manager of the addictions treatment programme, said it was the first time he had heard of an addiction to communication technology not allied to alcoholism or drug use, where it is sometimes a secondary problem. &quot;If people aren't replying to your texts, there is anger and sadness ... A ping on your phone can give you a buzz,&quot; he said.</p><p>Inappropriate use of a phone was an addiction that was likely to increase, he said, and he urged people to raise the matter with friends they thought were texting or emailing too often. The average number of texts sent has more than doubled since 2001 and 28 billion texts were sent in 2004 alone.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Graffiti can be viewed several different ways. Some view it as art and a way to express personal feelings. Others see it as a crime that only causes problems in society. The latter is also the conclusion that I have come to after much research on the subject.</p><p>I cannot agree with the argument that graffiti is a legitimate form of expression. I agree that it may be art because almost anything can be considered art. However, it is not respectful of others and it defaces property. The difference between graffiti and acceptable art is permission obtained by the artist. When people draw graffiti on the property of others it becomes a violation of property rights. It lowers property value and is very expensive to clean up. Do you want your tax dollars being spent to clean up other people's personal expressions on city buildings and walls? Would you want someone expressing their feelings on your very own private property? I believe that our right to freedom of speech should be protected; however, it should not be done at the expense of other citizens’ rights.</p><p>The fact that gangs use graffiti to &quot;express themselves&quot; is another reason why I do not agree that graffiti should be an accepted art form. Graffiti written by gangs is often used to intimidate others, recruit new members, advertise the sale of drugs, and mark gang boundaries. When we try to justify graffiti we are only encouraging further criminal gang related activity.</p><p>I am a true art lover. This is why I have to disagree when defenders of graffiti argue that graffiti should be considered beautiful art that should be accepted. The buildings and other structures that graffiti artists write on are also art and were not meant by the designer to have personal expressions painted all over them. If graffiti artists would like to display their works then they should display them in museums or on legal graffiti walls. These have been set up by the government to try to deter rampant and illegal graffiti throughout our cities. If the public would like to see their art then they will go see it in places where it will not be destructive to others. Much of the graffiti today is vulgar and offensive, and not appropriate for children to view. However, it is difficult not to be exposed to it when it is available all over cities.</p><p>When personal expression begins to violate other people's rights it should no longer be tolerated.</p>",

I have asked Ashleigh if she’d been to the mainland \n39) much.

The case centres on Michel Garel, a specialist in ancient documents at the National Library in Paris, who is alleged to have systematically stolen medieval texts to satisfy a demand from America. One manuscript, a 600-year old French Hebrew version of biblical books such as the Lessons of the Prophets, has been traced to a New York collector who bought it for £200,000 at Christie’s, the London and New York based auction house.

On trial are Marion True, a former Getty Museum antiquities curator and Robert Hecht, an American art dealer based in Paris. As a representative of the world’s richest art institution, True is accused of illegally obtaining 42 items during the 1980s and 1990s, including a 2,000-year statue of Apollo unearthed in Italy. The charges carry a 10-year sentence.

Below me were the inky waters of Victoria Harbour, and beyond, the skyscrapers of Hong Kong island, twinkling in the night. I had been intending to land on the runway, but alarmingly, it was crossing my screen from left to right instead of top to bottom. At this rate it looked as if I would shoot across it and end up in the harbour.</p><p>“Ease her nose up,” instructed flight engineer Ray Maidment, admirably keeping the panic out of his voice. I pulled the control column towards me, and turned it to the right to set our course for the runway of Kai Tak airport, one of the trickiest approaches in the world. The lights seemed terribly close, the runway terribly short. Would we land safely – or would our Boeing 7-47-200 plough into the murky harbour waters?</p><p>Climbing from the flight simulator’s cockpit ten minutes later, I felt pleased if a bit dizzy. We had landed so softly that no one in Virgin Atlantic’s upper class would have spilled a single drop of champagne. “For a first-timer, that was exceptional,” Ray said kindly.</p><p>Ray has landed at Kai Tak more times than most, if you count actual and virtual landings.

Unless there is significant rainfall over the next few weeks, the city’s Pejar Dam, which normally contains nine billion litres of water, will be drained of its last drop. While small Australian communities of a few hundred that have run dry have survived by trucking in water, Goulburn’s thirst for one million gallons a week is too large.</p><p>And as anxious Goulburn residents look to the skies and pray for rain, those living in Sydney, Australia’s largest city, only 125 miles away, are preparing themselves for severe water rationing.

        "text": "<p>Companies are eager these days to emphasise that they are organised around teams. A recent series of advertisements for Microsoft featured teams of employees from the giant software company getting excited about the various projects on which they were working together.</p><p>Headhunters are increasingly being asked to assemble teams of top executives, not merely to find a single high-performing CEO (Chief Executive Officer). And the bosses themselves are expected to be good at putting together teams.</p><p>The speed and efficiency with which effective teams can be brought together to resolve problems is crucial to success in the modern organisation. A recent <i>Harvard Business Review</i> article explains how teamwork within Linux, the software company, managed to build a barrage to protect the system against a virus that had breached a vulnerable spot: “Despite the need for the highest security, a group of some 20 people, scarcely any of whom had ever met, employed by a dozen different companies, living in as many time zones and straying far from their job descriptions, accomplished in about 29 hours what might have taken colleagues under the same roof weeks or months.”</p><p>The authors of the article argue that Linux was more successful at resolving the problem than its more conventionally structured rival Microsoft would have been. They describe the Linux people as “virtuoso practitioners of new work principles that produce energised teams and lower costs.”</p><p>But it is not only geeks in the software industry who have learnt to work in this way. The article says that the management methods of Toyota, the company that invented “lean manufacturing” (the remorseless elimination of waste) resemble the methods employed by the Linux community. One stroke of genius at Toyota was to apply the principles of lean manufacturing to inventory. What could be more wasteful than having shelves piled high with supplies that were not going to be used for weeks or months?</p><p>This gave rise to the “just-in-time” method of stock control. Toyota realised that the best way to make this system work was to allow the workers on the factory floor to control the flow of supplies because they had the information that would keep stocks at their lowest. This forced Toyota to decentralise decision-making and, unlike most Japanese companies, empower its shop-floor workers.</p>",

That is what girls do.&quot;</p><p>The change of policy was announced by the school in a newsletter.</p><p>Headteacher Marilyn Warden said: &quot;In order to give girls the same opportunities as boys for a safe, active and healthy lifestyle, while maintaining their modesty, it has been considered by our school governors that trousers for all pupils is a practical and appropriate dress requirement.&quot;</p><p>The rule is due to be phased in from September and will be compulsory by next year.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the local education authority - who was wearing a skirt - said it was the school's prerogative to make such a rule. The rule would be relaxed in a heat wave and &quot;appropriate&quot; clothes could then be worn.</p><p>It is not the first time that a school has banned skirts. Kesgrave High School in Ipswich did so last year to stop girls from wearing short skirts.</p><p>&quot;We no longer have teachers spending their time trying to stop girls wearing skirts halfway up their back,&quot; headteacher George Thomas said yesterday.</p><p>The rule at Kesgrave has had a second benefit, encouraging more girls to cycle to school.</p>",

Americans &quot;employed in a service-related industry&quot; are likely to groan inwardly as soon as they hear their customer has an Australian accent. All because tipping plays a lesser part in Australia's service environment. In Australia, you are more likely to leave something at the &quot;tip&quot; (garbage dump), than to leave a tip. &quot;Did he give you a good tip?&quot; is more likely to refer to information that aids in placing a bet on the horses or dogs than to payment for service.</p><p>The tipping issue can be a difficult one for both sides. Americans might be surprised to learn that Australians can feel self-conscious about leaving a tip. It took several years before I felt comfortable doing so, despite all the discussion about the low wages (sometimes less than $3 per hour). I just couldn't help feeling that leaving a couple of dollars on the table was the equivalent of saying &quot;you look poor enough to be grateful for this pittance I am prepared to throw your way&quot;.</p><p>I was surprised to get here and see how precisely a tip is calculated. It is not a casual throwing down of change. For example you might have $1.80 in change in your pocket, but if the 15% tip comes out at $1.45, then that's all that many people will leave. I have even seen people request change, rather than leave a tip that is 50c more than the calculation. Here's a tip on calculation - I have found it easiest to calculate the 15% by first calculating 10% by moving the decimal point (for example $27 gives you $2.70), and then adding half of the 10% ($2.70/2 = $1.35. $2.70 + $1.35 = $4.05. In this case I would think a round $4 is quite adequate).</p><p>I had also thought the tips would go up and down to reflect how you feel about the quality of the service. However, most people stick to the 15% or 20%. I have heard mutterings about how a tip is not deserved, but I have yet to see anyone act upon this.</p><p>In Australia, I was used to handing money directly to someone. So it was unusual at first to see people leave the tip on the table and walk away from it. Nicking off with a tip is obviously such a strong taboo, you can even leave it on the table when the next round of customers is preparing to sit down.</p><p>There is also an informal rule of etiquette that if one party is paying for the meal for everyone, then the other party will pay the tip.</p>",

A woman dressed in black walks past, and Matt receives a text message to follow her. He doesn't know who she is, or where she is going. All he knows is that he must follow her if he is to find Uncle Roy.</p><p>Matt is playing <i>Uncle Roy All Around You</i>, where for one day he is the main character in an elaborate experimental fantasy game played out across the streets of London. He also happens to be a pioneer of a new social phenomenon, urban gaming. If you thought the computer games of the 21st century are only ever played by couch potatoes addicted to the new generation of Xbox, Nintendo or PlayStation consoles, you'd be mistaken. For urban gamers are harnessing the power of global positioning systems (GPS), high-resolution screens and cameras and the latest mobile phones to play games across our towns and cities, where they become spies, celebrities and even Pac-Man.</p><p>&quot;The limitations of physical space makes playing the game exciting,&quot; says Michele Chang, a technology ethnographer with Intel. “There is also a social element,” says Chang. Last year, as a social experiment to see how people behave with real-world games, she created <i>Digital Street Game</i>, which ran for six months in New York. The aim was to acquire territory by performing stunts dictated by the game at public locations around the city, such as playing hopscotch at a crossroads while holding a hot-dog. &quot;People are more reserved than you would imagine,&quot; says Chang. Some players took to performing their stunt on rooftops to avoid being seen, she says, while others relished being ostentatious - like players of <i>Pac-Manhattan</i>, in which New Yorkers dress up as the video game icon Pac-Man and flee other gamers dressed up as ghosts.</p><p>Soon you may even be able to play games using phones without GPS hardware. One being played by 30,000 people in Sweden, Russia, Ireland, Finland and now China is called <i>BotFighters</i>, a role-playing game in which players explore an arena - in this case a city.</p><p>Stumble into another player's territory, and you have to fight them by exchanging virtual blows boosted by acquired superpowers. Each blow is sent via a text message. The game exploits the location-based services provided by cellphone companies, where the position of each phone is tracked by its network. As location-based services become ever more sophisticated and accurate, so will the games.</p>",

Several studies show that laughter produces endorphins, natural chemicals that ease pain and produce a feeling of euphoria, helping us cope with physical stress and chronic pain.</p><p><h4>Puppy love</h4></p><p>Researchers in the United States have found that spending time with pets is very effective at reducing stress. The scientists from the University of New York at Buffalo studied 240 married couples, half of whom had a dog or cat. They found that people with pets had lower resting heart rates and blood pressure than those without a cat or dog. They also found that pet owners reacted less to the difficult tasks they were set and their heart rates and blood pressure returned to normal levels more quickly.</p><p><h4>Bathtime</h4></p><p>Warm water relaxes the muscles and helps ease the aches and pains of the day. Raising the temperature of our bodies stimulates the production of white blood cells, which strengthens the immune system - one of the first systems to suffer when we are stressed. Hot water also encourages sweating which helps to remove toxins from the body.</p><p><h4>Mood lighting</h4></p><p>A home should be lit to create a sense of comfort and intimacy. Side lights and dimmers can make a much warmer and calmer environment than harsh overhead lighting. And why not indulge yourself in the most beautiful light of all? Candlelight. There's nothing more tranquil.</p><p><h4>Sweet dreams</h4></p><p>Sleep is essential for nourishing the mind and body so you are ready to spring into the next day anew. Make sure you get a good night's sleep and enjoy tomorrow.</p>",

        "text": "<p>The Moscow metro is updating its fare system once again. On Sunday, state-of-the-art smart cards will go on sale. The magnetic cards, which eventually will be issued to pensioners and all others entitled to ride free, will make it possible to count these passengers and help crack down on the large number of people who abuse the system. Passengers will only have to flash the cards within a few centimetres of the reading device, the yellow spot with a Moscow metro symbol already located on the turnstiles that accept tickets.</p><p>Moscow metro employees have been testing 35,000 cards since September of last year. “They are very good. Often there is no need to get them out of your pocket if you are wearing a coat -- just move the pocket up closer to the yellow circle,” said Galina Ibatulina, the chief of the Dynamo metro station. “Women can place the cards in an outside pocket of their handbags,” she said. However, the reading device is quite powerful, so it is probably not recommended to flash a purse with the card in front of the reading device if there are other magnetic cards in it.</p><p>Customers will be required to pay a small, so far unspecified deposit for the card itself.</p><p>Once the card has expired, the deposit will be returned in exchange for the used card.</p><p>By next year, the new cards will replace all existing documents which allow certain categories of people to ride for free. Under the current system, these people show their passes to metro employees and bypass the turnstiles to enter the stations.</p><p>Out of the 9 million people who use the metro daily a whopping 30 percent are estimated to ride for free or at cut rates. Many buy fake identification cards. It is yet to be seen whether the smart cards will really work as a deterrent against fare dodging.</p>",

        "example": "you have done enough sport.",
        "text": "<p>Sports shoes that calculate whether their owner has done enough exercise to allow time in front of the television have been devised in the UK.</p><p>The shoes - dubbed Square Eyes - contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves, based on the day's efforts.</p><p>The design was inspired by a desire to combat the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. &quot;We took a thorough look at current issues and childhood obesity really stood out. I wanted to tackle that with my design.&quot;</p><p>Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps.</p><p><h4>Daily amounts</h4></p><p>Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child should take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equates to precisely one minute of TV time.</p><p>The first prototype has two sensors in the sole - one that records steps and another, in the heel, that can be used to send data to the receiver with a firm stamp.</p><p>&quot;It's a good idea for integrating sensors into clothing,&quot; says Cliff Randall, at Bristol University, UK, who believes computers will routinely be built into garments in the future. But Randall says it will be more challenging to build a TV control unit that cannot easily be tricked. &quot;It's got to be easy to install and difficult to bypass,&quot; he adds.</p><p>Existing step counters normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to dupe. &quot;It is possible, but it would take a lot of effort,&quot; she says. &quot;That was one of my main design considerations.&quot;</p>",

Chilean newspapers were filled with reports (25) 10 papal rings and original gold statues from the Incan empire.</p><p>The hoard is supposedly buried 15 metres (50ft) deep on Robinson Crusoe island, also known as the Juan Fernández island, (26), the adventurer immortalised by Daniel Defoe as Robinson Crusoe. Selkirk was dumped on the island and lived alone for four years (27). His exploits brought worldwide attention to the islands.</p><p>For centuries treasure hunters have scoured the island in search of valuables which were reportedly buried there in 1715 by a Spanish sailor. Using everything from old Spanish ship logs (28), foreigners have made so many claims of discovering the lost treasure that islanders are usually sceptical of the announcements.</p><p>This most recent announcement, however, (29) because of the equipment used by the treasure hunters: a mini robot that can scan 50 metres deep into the earth.

American milk is rubbish.</p><p>Moreover, exiled from Britain for two months now, I am developing double-cream withdrawal symptoms. Those little plastic tubs with the pull-tops – you take them for granted, don’t you? Well, even in New York City it is flat-out impossible to find cream that isn’t “ultra-pasteurised”. The first thing I do on return to London is go buy 250ml of double cream. I can’t use it all. It spoils. I throw it away. I glory in its spoilage. Because American cream never spoils. It has the shelf-life of toxic waste. The theory seems to run that you market a product that never goes off by ensuring that it tastes awful to begin with.</p><p><h3>SUMMARY</h3></p><p>The author, an American living in Britain, is (0) in the US. He misses Britain and believes that (1) holidaying in the US might have similar feelings. He can do without (2) traffic, of course, but not without British (3) products which, in his opinion, are of a very (4) standard. He describes milk produced by American (5) as rubbish. He suggests British producers should be protected from (6) whose very low prices are forcing them out of (7). The technology used in America makes foodstuffs last (8) at the price of giving them an absolutely awful (9). The author says he prefers food that (10) to stuff that doesn’t taste like food in the first place.</p>",

        "text": "<p>In the early days of the medium, television was dismissed as merely “radio with pictures”. How on earth, then, to describe the latest consumer device from BSkyB that offers TV without any pictures at all?</p><p>The Skygnome, launched last summer, has caused a splash in the radio industry.</p><p>At first glance, the Gnome looks like the most bizarre product ever to have come out from BSkyB headquarters. The triangular receiver simply relays the audio from your TV set-top box to anywhere within a 100ft radius.</p><p>What's special about that? Nothing, at first sight … but take another look. It may very well be that the Gnome plays a vital part in what will be the next phase of the digital radio revolution. It is true that commentators on the Gnome have so far been unimpressed, but they have ignored two crucial factors. First, the huge listenership to digital radio via TV. Most of the publicity that digital radio generates focuses on the success of so-called kitchen radio, with sales of more than 1.4m sets to date. Yet, according to research from audience data provider Rajar, 29% of adults have listened to digital radio services via a TV platform. A device such as the Gnome that allows you to listen to your choice of more than 80 stations while you’re in the garden or the bath can only encourage this trend and boost listenership.</p><p>The second factor relates to how people listen, not just where they do it. Digital radio isn’t simply analogue radio broadcast differently. New services are increasingly available through broadband internet, digital TV and, soon, mobile phones, all of which are devices that offer a return path and are capable of transforming radio into a much more sophisticated and interactive medium.</p><p>Already 60% of consumers choose what music to buy while listening to the radio; how logical, then, that future radios will allow those consumers the opportunity, for instance, to buy the music they are listening to.</p><p>So let’s not look down on the Gnome. New devices such as this don’t simply provide a better version of what we have now in analogue radio. They represent a new beginning for the industry.</p>",

        "text": "<p><h4>JB Priestley’s Delights</h4></p><p>PARAGRAPH 0 | Priestley’s timeless, uplifting essays on the nature of delight have proved a huge hit with Sunday Express readers. Please keep your own delights coming – we will publish our third collection of your contributions soon.</p><p><h4>Women and Clothes</h4></p><p>PARAGRAPH 1 | Women who say they are indifferent to clothes, like men who say they do not mind what they eat, should be distrusted: there is something wrong. And men who sneer at a woman’s passionate concern about dress should be banished to the woods.</p><p>PARAGRAPH 2 | For my part I delight in women when they go into a conference – and huddle over new clothes. They seem to me then most themselves, and the furthest removed from my sex. They are at such times completely in their own world. They are half children, half witches. Note their attitude during these clothes conferences.</p><p>PARAGRAPH 3 | For example, their absolute clear sighted realism about themselves. We chaps always peer at ourselves through a haze of goodwill. We never believe we are as fat or as thin as other people say we are. The ladies are free of all such illusions. (Note the direct level glances they give each other on these occasions.)</p><p>PARAGRAPH 4 | So in their clothes conference, unlike all masculine conferences, there is no clash of illusions. All of them meet on the firm ground of fact. What is known is immediately taken into account: Kate’s left shoulder is higher than her right; Meg is very broad across the hips; Phyllis has very short legs.</p><p>PARAGRAPH 5 | The conference line – and very sensible too – is that we are all imperfect creatures, so how do we make the best of ourselves? (If politicians and their senior officials tried the same line at international conferences, they could change the world in a week.) Yet the whole clothes-huddle is not simply so much grim realism.</p><p>PARAGRAPH 6 | There is one grand illusion that they all share and never dream of challenging. It is the belief that out of these clothes, with necessary swaps and alterations, beauty and witchery can emerge, that somewhere here is the beginning of an enchanted life. And I for one find this altogether delightful.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Alongside the more familiar parental anxieties – such as placing children in good schools and universities – there is now a new cause for concern. Finding the right work experience, say teachers and employment experts, has become a key step to future career success.</p><p>The number of graduates with good grades is rocketing and employers, unable to distinguish between candidates on academic grounds, are looking for something extra on the CV. Thus, with more and more people getting into higher education, the importance of work experience is set to rise further. Those who can develop early the office skills that employers like – such as teamwork and personal communication – will prosper at the expense of the rest. Why employers now look beyond academic qualifications is illustrated by the experience of Allen & Overy, a City law practice. It is so inundated with applications that a spokesman said: “Due to the excessive numbers of applications we receive, we only consider people with very good degrees. Beyond that we look to see if applicants have interesting work experience. It is something that can set candidates apart.”</p><p>The irony is that – despite the government’s drive for equality in education – it is still who you know that counts. “You’ve really got to use your grapevine, people you know who are in interesting jobs, people you’ve studied with – do they have any friends or parents in jobs that you’d like to do?” Dr Peter Hawkins, a graduate employment expert at Liverpool University said.</p><p>The problem is partly that there are not enough openings to go round. The expansion of higher education has not led to an increase in the demand for ‘knowledge workers’. Up to 40% of graduates are in non-graduate work.</p><p>Even work experience opportunities that sound exciting can prove to be deeply disappointing. There is, of course, a fine line between work experience and ‘slave labour’. One 23-year-old graduate, who wished to remain anonymous, said last week that a three-month stint with a television production company had put him off a broadcasting career.</p><p>“It taught me that in television there is an attitude that work experience people are free labour,” he said. “We were expected to do the dirty work for nothing.&quot;</p><p>However, even that sort of experience can be valuable. Dr Martin Stephen, headmaster of St Paul’s boys’ school, suggested that working in a supermarket should not be sniffed at.</p><p>“The work experience that I would personally support would be stacking shelves – I think it’s a wonderful experience,” he said. “It’s the real world. And I think it’s not a bad thing to make a child live off what they earn for five or six weeks. That’s real learning.”</p>",

It begins with a procession of richly decorated historic boats and is followed by two-oar “gondolini” craft rowed by expert oarsmen.</p><p>“All it would take is 300 or 400 gondolas and the whole regatta would be forced to a stop. We have to make ourselves heard, not just as gondoliers but as Venetians who defend their city,” Luppi said.</p><p>The debate has been going on for decades. The number of taxis has soared since the 1960s and more recently larger boats – in addition to the regular water buses – have been allowed to carry up to 100 day-trippers from hotels and camp sites on the mainland into the heart of Venice.</p><p>As they disgorge their passengers they have to keep their engines revving at higher speeds than regulations permit or be pushed away from the landing stage, and this creates more turbulence.</p><p>Some gondoliers have developed hernias straining to keep their craft upright or to keep them from crashing into a quay. The gondolas, which used to last up to 25 years, now have a lifespan nearer 15 years.</p><p>The gondoliers want traffic police drafted in to impose speed limits and to catch boatmen ignoring one-way signs. But Paolo Costa, the mayor, argues that he is already cracking down on reckless navigation by putting up new signs, deploying more speed traps and impounding more boats.</p>",

For example, Headway helps young men with acquired brain injuries to readjust to family and working life, while the TreeHouse Trust educates children with autism. Praxis works with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants.</p><p>Pilotlight carefully matches its volunteers to the charity they can best assist after a thorough assessment of the charity’s needs.

Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar square honours his great deeds, but there was one incident, more than four years earlier, that showed a talent for pretending ignorance. Having lost an arm trying to capture Santa Cruz in the Canary Islands, and been blinded in one eye during a bloody battle off Corsica (though, contrary to popular belief, he didn’t wear an eye patch), Nelson was at sea again in 1801, this time fighting the Danes at the Battle of Copenhagen. He was second in command to the formidable Sir Hyde Parker, who for many years had led operations in the West Indies and North American waters. So it was with some pluck that Nelson, at the height of battle, chose to ignore Parker’s signal to cease fighting and withdraw the ships. When his lieutenant pointed out the signal, Nelson took up his telescope, placed it to his blind eye and proclaimed that he could see no such signal, reputedly adding the aside: “I have a right to be blind sometimes.” Nelson continued the attack, defeated the Danes, won the day for England and then replaced Parker as commander in chief of the Baltic fleet. While his audacious ruse made its mark on history, it also made its imprint on our language: the incident is seen as the inspiration for the phrase “to turn a blind eye”.</p>",

Fire also allowed humans to smoke and dry fish and meat, offering an early and invaluable form of food preservation. It also enabled them to experiment with a range of foods that could not be easily eaten raw or uncooked: the discovery of fire led to the invention of cooking.</p><p>(27) Some studies suggest that fire might have been used as long as 1.4 million years ago. This suggestion comes from the discovery of lumps of baked clay found together with animal bones and stone tools at a stone-age site in Kenya. However, some scientists now believe that a burning tree stump, or even volcanic heating, might be capable of creating the same effect.</p><p>(28) Scientists have made these finds at several sites in Europe, such as Vertesszollos in Hungary and Menez-Dregan in northwest France.</p><p>(29) Archaeologists have found fragments of burnt flint and charred remnants from fruit trees at a site in Israel, where they believe humans had learnt to control fire as early as 790,000 years ago, much earlier than previously accepted.</p><p>(30) It required the realisation that fire consumed fuel, which led to the logical conclusion that new fuel needed to be added to keep the fire from going out. Tending a fire also meant that these primitive human ancestors had to have a concept of the future. They must have realised that they had to collect firewood long before the fire went out.
