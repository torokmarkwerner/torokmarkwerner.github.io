The dogs included in the study were pets, volunteered by their owners. First, researchers taught the dogs to use a special smell-testing device. Then, they collected sweat and breath samples from the human participants under two different conditions: in a non-stressful and a stressful situation. When people were calm, their blood pressure and heart rates were measured and then they were asked to wipe their skin with a clean piece of cloth. Then they had to put the cloth sample in a tube and breathe on it hard three times.</p><p>The study team then collected another round of breath and sweat samples a few minutes later, after the people had completed a difficult maths task, counting backward in their heads from 9,000 in units of 17 in front of two researchers for three minutes. The researchers kept telling the people to hurry up. After the task the participants reported feeling stressed, and their blood pressure and heart rate had gone up.</p><p>Then the dogs were given a relaxed and a stressed sample from each person. The dogs correctly identified the stressed sample in 94% of 720 tests.</p><p>The study provides evidence that dogs can smell stress from breath and sweat.

Look out for the icon on the game that shows what age classification it has been given.</p>(1)<p>Don’t share identifying details like your full name, mobile phone number or address. Sharing this type of information could put you at great risk.</p>(2)<p>To avoid being hacked, pick a strong password. Make sure you include a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. Treat your password like your toothbrush: you shouldn't share it with anyone else.</p>(3)<p>Online friends are still strangers even if you have been talking to them for a long time and meeting someone you have only been in touch with online can be dangerous.</p>(4)<p>Make sure you know what tools are available if someone is being aggressive in a game. Learn how to block, mute, delete and report on the games and consoles you use.</p>(5)<p>Games have been designed to be fun and exciting and to keep us coming back for more. But remember, for healthy gameplay, it’s important to stop for at least five minutes every hour.</p>(6)<p>You may be asked to pay for items in the game or to upgrade to the next level. The amount may seem small, but you can run up a large bill before you even realise it. We suggest blocking in-app purchases.</p>(7)<p>Don’t break the law by downloading non-copyrighted games or cheat programmes to skip to a higher level.</p>",

Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in engineering, was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Surveyors for his house, known as <i>Cubo</i>. The Royal Institute decided to give top prize to the house because of its use of low-cost eco-friendly material, and the speed with which it could be constructed. The house could be manufactured in a week, constructed in four hours and costs £60 per square metre.</p><p>The competition was aiming to find practical solutions to housing problems that the world’s cities face. There were more than 1,200 competitors; they were narrowed down to 12 finalists, who were given a mentor from the Royal Institute to help develop their ideas over several months and then finally build their houses.</p><p>The competition head judge said: “There is a need for clean and comfortable places to live for future generations. There were many exciting designs among the projects. However, Earl’s idea stood out for its cheap and simple solution to the world’s growing accommodation problem.”</p><p>The winner, Forlales has already selected a suitable area of land to start building his <i>Cubo</i> houses in Manila, capital of the Philippines, because there are huge pressures on housing in the city. He plans to begin work next year. He said: “<i>Cubo</i> started as an idea while I was spending time at my grandparents’ house – it is great that it will now become a reality.”</p>",

Lying in bed isn’t exactly the same as being weightless, but it affects the body in a similar way.</p><p>When astronauts spend a long time in an environment with no gravity, their bodies are affected in many ways; for example, their hearts don’t pump as hard, their muscles become weaker because they no longer have to work against gravity, and their bones may break more easily. There may also be changes in their immune systems and sleep habits.</p><p>The goal of the present study, which will take 88 days altogether, is to measure the effects of weightlessness, and also to find ways to prevent problems. During the first two weeks, the volunteers’ levels of health and fitness will be measured. Then, they will spend 60 days lying in bed with their heads slightly lower than their bodies. They will have to do everything while lying down, including eating, brushing their teeth, and going to the bathroom. The rule is that they must have at least one shoulder touching the bed at all times. Half of the volunteers in the study will be taking special food supplements to see if they help reduce the health problems caused by weightlessness. The last two weeks of the study will be spent taking more measurements and trying to build up their strength again.</p><p>Volunteers must be men between the ages of 20 and 45 who are in perfect health and physically active.

Wishing to demonstrate the two different languages, village chief Oliver Ibang calls over his two young children.</p><p>He holds up a cup and asks his daughter what it is called. &quot;It's <i>ogbala</i>,&quot; she says, without thinking for a moment. But in Ubang's &quot;male language&quot; the word for cup is <i>nko</i>. There are some other examples, such as the word for clothing, which is <i>nki</i> for men and <i>ariga</i> for women.</p><p>It is not clear exactly how many words are different in the two languages. Also, there is no pattern, such as whether the words are commonly used or linked to traditional roles for men or women. There are a lot of words that men and women have in common, then there are others which are totally different depending on your sex. They don't sound alike, they don't have the same letters, they are completely different words. However, both men and women are able to understand each other as well as anywhere else in the world. This might be partly because boys grow up speaking the female language, as they spend most of their childhoods with their mothers and other women. However, by the age of 10, boys are expected to speak the &quot;male language&quot;.</p><p>Ubang people are extremely proud of their language difference but there are different theories about how it happened. &quot;God created Adam and Eve and they were Ubang people,&quot; says the chief. &quot;God's plan was to give each ethnic group two languages, but after creating the two languages for the Ubang, he realised that he simply didn’t have enough languages to hand out. So he stopped,&quot; he explains.</p><p>&quot;That's why Ubang has the benefit of two languages – we are different from other people in the world.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

A combination of three reasons makes the third Monday of the year the most miserable. Understanding that Christmas really is over, the realisation of all the holiday expenses and the fact that most of us are back at work all play a part. First invented in Britain, <i>Blue Monday</i> is especially sad in the northern half of the world, where it’s also deep, dark midwinter.</p><p>It was in 2005 that Cliff Arnall, a university lecturer from Wales, dreamt up his gloomy calculation using the above three main factors to find the date of the most depressing day in the year. He also took into account things like the weather, the period since we’ve broken our New Year’s resolutions and our general motivational level.</p><p>However, there is hope, say psychologists, as Blue Monday was really all a marketing trick. January in the UK is peak holiday booking time and the original research was paid for by a travel agent who wanted to persuade people to cheer up by heading to the beach. Preferably through them.</p><p>While there is no scientific evidence of Blue Monday on the third Monday of January – or any other Monday in a year – research shows us that our mood is significantly better on Fridays and over the weekend in general. This is generally because we get more sleep and “me time” to spoil ourselves.</p><p>Dr Burke, a psychologist, says that “since Blue Monday is a trick that may affect our thinking and emotions so much, we should turn it into Happy Monday. Instead of searching for all that is going badly on the day, think of all the good things that happen around you – that woman who held the bus door to prevent it from closing, the old lady who smiled at you for no reason or the little boy who gave you a big hug.”</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.news.com.au)</i></p>",

But sadly the other geese made it clear that the tiny gosling wasn’t welcome.</p><p>Mike decided he would take the gosling home and care for her until she was fully grown, at which point he would release her into the wild. But the goose, who Mike named Kylie, had other plans. Every time Mike tried to let Kylie fly away, she just kept coming back.

Kylie now follows him everywhere – to the shops, when he’s out on his boat, around the house.</p><p>‘Kylie’s personality is a lot like a person’s,’ says Mike. ‘She has her good days and bad days. She can do things she knows she is not supposed to. Like boarding other people’s boats, harassing neighbors or stealing things from them. She loves to steal small items like keys, wallets, flip flops and throw them in the lake.’</p><p>When they’re together (which is pretty much all the time), Mike and Kylie love to go to Starbucks and watch TV. Kylie loves all shows on the Discovery Channel. She’s also a huge fan of the Ellen Show and Animal Planet.

But today, you don’t even have to be a manager to give presentations – staff at every level are expected to stand up (9). Below you can read some advice from experts.</p><p>“I always begin my planning with the end in mind,” says Karen Glossop, psychologist. “What are the one or two main points (10)? Plan the talk around your main points and build the structure accordingly.”</p><p>Another expert, who coaches people in communication and presentation skills, suggests that you should make your speech memorable. “Create an opening that grabs attention (11). We naturally remember the first and last bits better than the middle.”</p><p>When clients tell him that they don’t have time to prepare, he advises them to spend just 10 minutes thinking about what it is they want to say: “What is the one thing you want people to take away? When your audience leaves the room, (12)? That way you will structure your message well.”</p><p>The most important thing is to remember your main ideas and not the exact words, says the president of the Academy of Public Speakers. “Prepare in advance (13). While doing so, focus on the message rather than trying to remember every single word in order,” he says. “As no one will know exactly (14), leaving out a word will not cause a problem.”</p><p>“When you practise, include any slides, flip charts, aids or props (15),” he adds. How you present your speech is equally, or maybe even more important than what you say. Speaking slowly and clearly is very important. Don’t rush through your talk, no matter how much (16). “Taking time to pause and breathe helps the speaker to feel less stressed, and helps support the voice”.</p><p>Psychologists say we should never turn down a chance to speak.

        "text": "<p>Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby made the announcement after a meeting of leaders of the Anglican church. He is currently working with high-ranking members of other Christian churches to agree on a fixed date for Easter.</p><p>In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle.</p><p>The issue is back on the agenda as Easter is the most important Christian festival. It celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday. The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew. Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen &quot;in between five and ten years’ time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would love to see it before I retired,&quot; he said, although he warned that the first time they tried to make such a change was in the 10th century. An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then.</p><p>Easter is on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, which usually falls on the 21<sup>st</sup> of March, when day and night are equally long. This means that Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22<sup>nd</sup> March and 25<sup>th</sup> April. However, the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, and so it has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity.</p><p>It is yet to be seen whether this latest attempt to fix the date will be successful.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

Looking at their effects on pilots on long flights, the researchers reported: “Naps can greatly improve both your energy level and general mood.”</p><p>Naps are of critical importance to pilots, but they can have the same benefits for anyone. Taking a nap for about half an hour is the most practical. If you want to try it yourself, have a coffee beforehand, so that it takes effect towards the end of your nap. Don’t sip your coffee too slowly, as you might find it’s already taking effect as you begin your nap.</p><p>The truth is that we can nap anywhere. The best way is to find a spot where you can make yourself comfortable at some point during the afternoon period – an unused office, the sofa in the staff room or even in the park. Then close your eyes and just let go. Some people say that they simply “can’t nap” and they won’t be able to fall asleep. But here is the thing: it doesn’t matter. What’s important is that you use this period to close your eyes and disconnect from the world for a short while.</p><p>After a nap, take five minutes to become aware of your surroundings and have a cup of tea or a glass of water. One more thing - light will reduce any tiredness quickly, so you will be full of energy and enjoy all the benefits of your nap.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

When he left, his bike was gone.” He was outraged.</p><p>“I realized that the biggest problem is that most people don’t know that the lock that they bought for $20 is absolutely worthless. It costs at least $100 to get at least somewhere close to where you can at least limit the chances of a thief wanting to steal your bike. With the right tools a thief could cut through most locks in less than a minute. Thieves talk in seconds: a 15-second bike, a 20-second bike, and it goes up to 60-second bikes.”</p><p>Idzkowski created a U-shaped lock of carbon and steel with a hollow chamber to hold a pressurized gas. When someone cuts about 30% of the way into the lock the gas erupts in the direction of the cut. “It’s pretty much immediately vomit inducing,” Idzkowski said.</p><p>The inventors have tested it on themselves and volunteers at distances of 50cm and 2 metres. “At 50cm it was pretty bad.

During the second half, the prince and Michael Owen, a former England striker, joined in a training session with royal staff.</p><p>The prince, who presented medals to 150 volunteers before the kick-off, recognised the efforts of the founders of local clubs, coaches, referees and other officials at a reception to celebrate the anniversary on 7th October. The prince told the guests, &quot;Over its 150 years, football has remained a wonderful example of the power of community and of our ability to come together to organise and to enjoy a simple pastime.&quot;</p><p>The Queen gave permission for the match to take place at the palace. The prince joked: &quot;Today we will be playing football on my grandmother's lawn. One warning, though – if anyone breaks a window, you can answer to her.&quot;</p><p>Wembley groundsman Tony Stones worked with royal household gardeners to create the pitch in the 39-acre garden. The lawn had to be repaired following garden parties and the Coronation Festival in the summer.</p><p>Civil Service FC were selected to take part in the game and they suggested Polytechnic, also based in Chiswick, west London, as opponents. Polytechnic FC manager said: &quot;We first played 120 years ago – so there's a fair bit of history between the two of us.&quot;</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.mid-day.com)</i></p>",

It is hard to avoid writers in Reykjavik, the capital city, hosting the festival I visited.</p><p>&quot;Does it get rather competitive?&quot; I ask the young novelist, Kristin Eirikskdottir. &quot;Yes. Especially as I live with my mother and partner, who are also full-time writers. But we try to publish in alternate years so we do not compete too much.&quot;</p><p>Special saga tours show us public buildings, on the walls of which you can see some of these old stories. Dating from the 13th Century, Icelandic sagas tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century. Sagas are written on napkins and coffee cups. Our guide stands up mid-tour to recite his own poetry – our taxi driver's father and grandfather write biographies.</p><p>Reykjavik is flooded with writers when it is book festival time. &quot;They write everything</p><p>- modern sagas, poetry, children's books, literary and erotic fiction - but the biggest boom is in crime writing,&quot; Agla Magnusdottir, head of the new Icelandic Literature Centre, tells me. That is perhaps no surprise in this Nordic nation. &quot;Writers are respected here, they live well. Some even get a salary.&quot;</p><p>She also tells us about Iceland's Nobel Literature Laureate, Halldor Laxness, whose books are sold in petrol stations and tourist centres. Locals name their cats after Laxness and visit his home. &quot;When Laxness won the Nobel Prize in 1955 he put modern Icelandic literature on the map,&quot; she tells me. &quot;He gave us confidence to write.&quot;</p><p>But some fear a book crisis, too. Iceland has so many writers that there is huge pressure on publishers.</p><p>Suddenly I notice some famous people. One of them, Iceland’s musical superstar Bjork attends several of the festival events. &quot;It is a small place.

Ten years ago, people would rather hang over a crocodile pit than admit they met online. But today the climate is much less disapproving. Dating has changed extremely fast. It had to. Not only does the UK have a high concentration of single people, but many of us work in virtually single-sex environments. Couples I know are too busy to have dinner parties. We lack the village hall dances our parents went to. Like people in the US, we welcome different ways to meet. A third of all new relationships start online. It’s our best matchmaker. Among my friends, I don’t know anyone who hasn’t met online.</p><p>Survey results reveal the British to be enlightened and open-minded about how we meet a significant other. As someone who fell in love online, I do think internet dating is a good thing. Of course it’s lovely to meet in “real life”. The fact that someone has walked across a room and chosen you is a great help. But that room is getting smaller. Sign up to a dating website and you have more than 1,000 matches. Of course you won’t always fancy each other. But you can at least be kind and friendly for an hour. To be honest, the first meeting isn’t a date. You’re meeting for a chat to see if you would like to spend more time together.</p><p>Yes, it can feel a bit like an audition. But it’s good to be put into a situation where you have to put your cards on the table.

It also has the strongest flavour, which is often compared to chocolate. Black tea has the longest shelf life of any tea; it keeps its flavour for several years. Don't worry if some people call black tea red, because this is its name in several Asian countries.</p><p><b>White Tea</b></p><p>White tea is the rarest of all teas and it is made with very young leaves, which have a light colour. It is widely believed that the caffeine level of white tea is higher than in green tea, although some scientists say the opposite. Studies have also shown that it is better against viruses and bacteria than green tea.</p><p><b>Green Tea</b></p><p>Green tea is closely related to white tea. It has a similar taste, but it uses rolled leaves. Green tea has been studied far more than any other tea and many scientists say it is good for people on a slimming diet. If you don’t like those visits to the dentist, there is good news for you: green tea keeps your teeth healthy, too.</p><p><b>Oolong Tea</b></p><p>The final type of true tea is oolong tea. As for its strength, it falls between green and black. It has neither the rosy aroma of black tea nor the grassy taste of green tea. Instead, oolong tea is described as bitter with a sweet melon-like aftertaste.

        "text": "<p>According to Amsterdam’s tourism board, the canal-crossed Dutch city is one of the most cycle-friendly places in the world, but recently locals have become less enthusiastic about the tourists that come to see Amsterdam on two wheels.</p><p>&quot;The problem is that we Dutch are good cyclists. We're like anarchists on bikes who know how to break the rules,&quot; said Rolf Hermsen, who is one of the many city residents who use their bikes to get around. &quot;The tourists try to keep the rules, but they can't cycle properly. They can't cycle while looking for traffic behind them, so they just fall over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are people who say tourists need more instructions to ride bikes,&quot; said Jo Ligtvoeld from the Tourist Board. &quot;More and more Dutch people are complaining about tourists. I think it's because Amsterdam is a small city compared to other European capitals.&quot;</p><p>Amsterdam also has a reputation as a &quot;freedom city&quot; for allowing marijuana smoking and for its red light district. The city attracts thousands of tourists each year, who are often responsible for noise pollution and garbage on the streets. The Tourist Board says that it’s these visitors, rather than the cycling ones, that create the most problems with local residents.</p><p>However, when it comes to cycling, Amsterdam residents are good at spotting the tourist-on- wheels. &quot;Tourists should, just like the locals, have lights on their bikes and follow general traffic instructions. Just because Amsterdam likes freedom, that does not mean there are no rules to be followed,&quot; Jo Ligtvoeld said.</p><p>Her solution to the conflict between visitors and residents is to attract tourists to the less busy parks and cycleways of Amsterdam's quieter suburbs. Anyway, if you do choose to cycle in Amsterdam, the Tourism Board's website helpfully explains where you can rent bikes and how to follow Amsterdam's traffic rules.</p><p><i style='font-size:small'>(www.bbc.co.uk)</i></p>",

One visitor to the gallery yesterday couldn’t get over what they described as her ‘grey, smoker’s skin’, while another commented that her mouth appears to be set in a grimace, (15).</p><p>To be fair, royal portraiture has always been a subjective issue. Rolf Harris, (16), admitted that in the early stages he made the monarch look like a ‘pork butcher from Norwich’.</p><p>Yesterday Kate and her family spent around ten minutes looking at the picture and (17), after which the media were allowed in.</p><p>Asked what the duchess thought of his work, Mr Emsley said yesterday: ‘I think, from what I can see this morning, she’s delighted with it.
